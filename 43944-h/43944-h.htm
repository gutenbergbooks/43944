<p class="stl">SHALL RORAIMA<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> BE GIVEN UP TO VENEZUELA?</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Shall</span> Roraima be handed over to Venezuela?
Shall the mysterious mountain long known to
scientists as foremost among the wonders of our earth&mdash;regarded
by many as the greatest marvel of the world&mdash;become
definitely Venezuelan territory?</p>

<p>This is the question that hangs in the balance at the
time these words are being written, that is inseparably
associated&mdash;though many of the public know it not&mdash;with
the dispute that has arisen about the boundaries
of British Guiana.</p>

<p>Ever since Sir Robert Schomburgk first explored the
colony at the expense of the Royal Geographical Society
some sixty years ago, Roraima has remained an unsolved
problem of romantic and fascinating interest, as
attractive to the &lsquo;ordinary person&rsquo; as to the man of
science. And to those acquainted with the wondrous
possibilities that lie behind the solution of the problem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
the prospect of its being handed over to a country
so little worthy of the trust as is Venezuela, cannot
be contemplated without feelings of disappointment
and dismay.</p>

<p>This is not the place in which to give a long description
of Roraima. It will suffice here to say that its
summit is a table-land which, it is believed, has been
isolated from all the rest of the world for untold ages;
no wilderness of ice and snow, but a fertile country of
wood and stream, and, probably, lake. Consequently it
holds out to the successful explorer the chance&mdash;the
probability even&mdash;of finding there hitherto unknown animals,
plants, fish. In this respect it exceeds in interest
all other parts of the earth&rsquo;s surface, not excepting the
polar regions; for the latter are but ice-bound wastes,
while Roraima&rsquo;s mysterious table-land lies in the tropics
but a few degrees north of the equator.</p>

<p>Why, then, it may be asked, have our scientific
societies not exhibited more zeal in the solving of the
problem presented by this strange mountain? Why
is it that unlimited money can, apparently, be raised for
expeditions to the poles, while no attempt has been
made to explore Roraima? Yet, sixty years ago, the
Royal Geographical Society could find the money to
send Sir Robert Schomburgk out to explore British
Guiana&mdash;indeed, it is to that fact that we owe the
discovery of Roraima&mdash;but nothing has been done since.
Had the good work thus begun been followed up, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
should to-day have been able to show better reason for
claiming Roraima as a British possession. But, as the
writer of the article in the <cite>Spectator</cite> quoted on page <a href="#Page_3">3</a>
says, &ldquo;we leave the mystery unsolved, the marvel
uncared for.&rdquo; This article is commended to the perusal
of those interested in the subject, as also are the following
books, which give all the information at present
available, viz.&mdash;Mr. Barrington Brown&rsquo;s &lsquo;Canoe and Camp
Life in British Guiana,&rsquo; and Mr. Boddam-Whetham&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Roraima and British Guiana.&rsquo; Mr. Im Thurn&rsquo;s &lsquo;Among
the Indians of British Guiana&rsquo; should also be mentioned,
since it contains references to Roraima, though the
author did not actually visit the mountain, as in the
case of the first named.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the confusion and uncertainty
that prevail as to the international status of this unique
mountain, it may be mentioned that in the map of
British Guiana which Sir Robert Schomburgk drew out
for the British Government, it is placed within the
British frontier. But in the map of the next Government
explorer, Mr. Barrington Brown&mdash;&lsquo;based,&rsquo; he
says, &lsquo;upon Schomburgk&rsquo;s map&rsquo;&mdash;it is placed just inside
the Venezuelan boundary; and no explanation is given
of the apparent contradiction. Again, another authority,
Mr. Im Thurn (above referred to), Curator of the
Museum at Georgetown (the capital of the colony), in
his book says that Roraima &ldquo;lies on the extreme edge
of the colony, or perhaps on the other side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
<em>Brazilian</em> boundary.&rdquo; These references show the obscurity
in which the whole matter is at present involved.</p>

<p>Apart, however, from the special interest that surrounds
Roraima owing to the inaccessible character of
its summit,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> it is of very great geographical importance,
from the fact that it is the highest mountain in all that
part of South America, <abbr><i>i.e.</i></abbr>, in all the Guianas, in Venezuela,
and in the north-east part of Brazil. Indeed, we
must cross Brazil, that vast country of upwards of three
million square miles, to find the nearest mountains that
exceed in height Roraima. Consequently, it forms the
apex of the water-shed of that part of South America;
and it is, in fact, the source of several of the chief
feeders of the great rivers Essequibo, Orinoco and
Amazon. Schomburgk, in pointing this out, dwelt
strongly upon the importance of the mountain to British
Guiana, and insisted that its inclusion within the British
boundary was a geographical necessity.</p>

<p>Finally, Sir Robert&rsquo;s brother, Richard Schomburgk,
a skilled botanist, who had visited almost all parts of
Asia and Africa in search of orchids and other rare
botanical productions, tells us that the country around
Roraima is, from a botanical point of view, one of the
most wonderful in the world. &ldquo;Not only the orchids,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;but the shrubs and low trees were unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
to me. Every shrub, herb and tree was new to me,
if not as to family, yet as to species. I stood on the
border of an unknown plant zone, full of wondrous forms
which lay as if by magic before me.... Every step
revealed something new.&rdquo; (&lsquo;Reissen in Britisch Guiana,&rsquo;
Leipzig, vol. ii., p. 216.)</p>

<p>Are our rulers, in their treatment of the question,
bearing these facts sufficiently in mind? Are they as
keenly alive as are the Venezuelans to the importance
of Roraima? If they are, there is no sign of it; for
while, in the Venezuelan statements of their case,
there are lengthy, emphatic, and repeated references
to the importance of Roraima, on the English side&mdash;in
the English press even&mdash;there is scarcely a word
about it.</p>

<p>From these observations it will be seen that there is
reason to fear we may be on the point of allowing one
of the most scientifically interesting and geographically
important spots upon the surface of the globe to slip
out of our possession into that of a miserable little state
like Venezuela, where civil anarchy is chronic, and
neither life nor property is secure.</p>

<p>One of the avowed objects of this book, therefore, is
to stimulate public interest, and arouse public attention
to the considerations that actually underlie the &lsquo;Venezuelan
Question,&rsquo; as well as to while away an idle hour
for the lovers of romance.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that, if it is too late to retain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
the wonderful Roraima as exclusively British&mdash;and to
effect this it would be well worth our while to barter
away some other portion of the disputed territory&mdash;then
an arrangement might be come to to make it neutral
ground. Standing, as it does, in the corner where the
three countries&mdash;Brazil, Venezuela and British Guiana&mdash;meet,
it is of importance to all three, and, no doubt,
in such an endeavour, we should have the support of
Brazil as against Venezuela.</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p>With regard to the oft-discussed question of the situation
of the traditional city of Manoa, or El Dorado&mdash;as
the Spaniards called it&mdash;most authorities, including
Humboldt and Schomburgk, agree in giving British
Guiana as its probable site. We are told that it stood
on an island in the midst of a great lake called
&lsquo;Parima&rsquo;; but no such lake is now to be found in
South America anywhere near the locality indicated.
An explanation of the mystery, however, is afforded by
the suggestion that such a great lake, or inland sea,
almost certainly existed at one time in precisely this
part of the continent; in that case what are now
mountains in the country would then have been
islands.</p>

<p>Indeed, most of British Guiana lies somewhat low,
and it is estimated that if the <em>highlands</em> were to sink
two thousand feet the whole country would be under
water&mdash;the mountain summits excepted&mdash;and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
would then be only &lsquo;a narrow strait&rsquo; between the
Roraima range and the Andes. In this great supposed
ancient lake the group of islands now represented by
mountain summits might well have been the home of
a powerful and conquering race&mdash;as is to-day Japan
with its group of more than three thousand islands&mdash;and
Roraima, as the highest, and therefore the most
easily defensible, may very well have been selected as
their fastness, and the site of their capital city.</p>

<p>Schomburgk thus states his speculations upon the
point, in his book on British Guiana, page 6:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The geological structure of this region leaves but
little doubt that it was once the bed of an inland lake
which, by one of those catastrophes of which even later
times give us examples, broke its barriers, forcing for
its waters a path to the Atlantic. May we not connect
with the former existence of this inland sea the fable of
the lake Parima and the El Dorado? Thousands of
years may have elapsed; generations may have been
buried and returned to dust; nations who once wandered
on its banks may be extinct and exist no
more in name; still, tradition of Parima and the El
Dorado survived these changes of time; transmitted
from father to son, its fame was carried across the
Atlantic and kindled the romantic fire of the chivalric
Raleigh.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p>As a natural sequence to the foregoing arises the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
inquiry, What sort of people were those who inhabited
this island city, or who &lsquo;wandered on the banks&rsquo; of the
great lake? Here much is to be learned from the recent
discoveries of the Government of the United States who,
of late years, have devoted liberal sums to pre-historic
research. The money so expended has been the means
of unearthing evidence of a startling character&mdash;relics of
a former civilisation that existed in America ages before
the time of its discovery by Christopher Columbus.
The Spaniards, as we know, found races that were
white, or nearly so; but these later discoveries go to
show that long anterior to these&mdash;at a time, in fact,
probably coeval with what we call the Egyptian civilisation&mdash;America
was peopled with a white race fully
as cultured, as advanced in the sciences, and as powerful
on their own ground as the ancient Egyptians;
and as handsome in personal appearance&mdash;if some
of the heads and faces on the specimens of pottery
may be accepted as fair examples&mdash;as the ancient
Greeks.</p>

<p>It has long been known that America possesses extraordinary
relics of a former civilisation in what are
known as the great &lsquo;earthworks,&rsquo; which are still to be
seen scattered about in many parts of the continent,
and which, as vast engineering works, challenge comparison
with the pyramids themselves. But now discovery
has gone much further; bas-reliefs and pottery
have been found that set forth with marvellous fidelity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
many minute details concerning this pre-historic people&mdash;their
personal appearance, and their ornaments and
habiliments; the style of wearing the hair and the
beard; and other particulars that can be appreciated
only by inspection and study of the reduced fac-similes
lately printed and issued by the Government of the
United States.</p>

<p>Many of them relate to the custom of human sacrifice
which, as most people are probably aware, prevailed
largely in America when the Spaniards first landed
there; though few, perhaps, know the terrible extent
to which it was carried. Prescott tells us that few
writers have ventured to estimate the yearly number
of victims at less than twenty thousand, while many
put it as high as fifty thousand, in Mexico alone! If
we consider that the lowest of these estimates represents
an average of some four hundred a week, or nearly sixty
a day, such figures are appalling! And now we learn,
beyond the possibility of a doubt, that the same practices
obtained in America in times that must have been
ages before the Spanish conquest, and, judging by the
frequency of the representations of such things in these
old bas-reliefs, as extensively. In these sculptures we
can see the very shape of the knives used; the form of
the plates or platters on which severed heads of victims
were placed, and other such details; and in a certain
series we are enabled to note the curious point, that,
while the officiating priests always wear full beards, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
victims appear to have usually possessed no hirsute
adornments, or to have &lsquo;shaved clean,&rsquo; as we term it.
It may be added that these ancient white people seem
to have been a totally different race from those the
Spaniards found on the continent; and that between
the two there is believed to have been a gap lasting for
many ages, during which the country was overrun by
Indian or other barbaric hordes; though how or why
this came about is one of those mysteries that will
probably never be unravelled.</p>

<hr class="l2" />
<hr class="l2" />

<p>In conclusion, I have to acknowledge my indebtedness
to the writers whose books of travel I have named for
the information I have made use of; as well as to
express a hope that the writer of the review in the
<cite>Spectator</cite> will regard with indulgence the liberties I
have taken with his admirable article. I am sanguine
enough to believe, however, that I shall have the sympathy
and good wishes of all these in the endeavour
here made to arouse public attention to the real meaning
and importance of the &lsquo;Venezuelan Question&rsquo;; and
to add to the number of those who feel an interest
in the future status and ultimate exploration of the
mysterious Roraima. I wish also to express my thanks
to Messrs. Leigh Ellis and Fred Hyland, the artists to
whom the illustrations were entrusted, for the thought
and care they have bestowed upon the work, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
successful manner in which they have carried out my
conceptions.</p>

<p>For the rest&mdash;if objection be taken to the accounts
of the mountain and what is to be found on its summit
given by the characters in my story&mdash;I desire to claim
the licence of the romance-writer to maintain their
accuracy&mdash;till the contrary be proved. If this shall
serve to stimulate to renewed efforts at exploration,
so much the better, and another of my objects in
writing the book will thereby have been attained.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Beneath</span> the verandah of a handsome, comfortable-looking
residence near Georgetown, the principal
town of British Guiana, a young man sat one morning
early in the year 1890, attentively studying a volume
that lay open on a small table before him. It was easy
to see that he was reading something that was, for him
at least, of more than ordinary interest, something that
seemed to carry his thoughts far away from the scene
around him; for when, presently, he raised his eyes
from the book, they looked out straight before him with
a gaze that evidently saw nothing of that on which they
rested.</p>

<p>He was a handsome young fellow of, perhaps, twenty-two
years of age, rather tall, and well-made, with light
wavy hair, and blue-grey eyes that had in them an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
introspective, somewhat dreamy expression, but that
nevertheless could light up on occasion with an animated
glance.</p>

<p>The house stood on a terrace that commanded a view
of the sea, and, in the distance, white sails could be seen
making their way across the blue water in the light
breeze and the dazzling sunlight. Nearer at hand were
waving palms, glowing flowers, humming insects and
gaudily-coloured butterflies&mdash;all the beauties of a tropical
garden. On one side of him was the open window of a
sitting-room that, shaded, as it was, by the verandah,
looked dark and cool compared with the glare of the
scorching sun outside.</p>

<p>From this room came the sounds of a grand piano and
of the sweet voice of a girl singing a simple and pathetic
ballad.</p>

<p>At the moment the song ceased a brisk step was heard
coming up the path through the garden, and a good-looking
young fellow of tall figure and manly air made
his way to where the other still sat with his eyes fixed
on vacancy, as one who neither sees nor hears aught of
what is going on about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, Leonard!&rdquo; the new-comer exclaimed, with a light
laugh, &ldquo;caught you dreaming again, eh? In another of
your reveries?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other roused himself with a start, and looked to
see who was his visitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Jack,&rdquo; he then answered with a slight
flush. &ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;I suppose I must have been dreaming
a little, for I did not hear you coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bet I guess what you were dreaming about,&rdquo; said
the one addressed as Jack. &ldquo;Roraima, as usual, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard looked a little conscious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he admitted, smiling. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
seriously, &ldquo;I have just been reading something
that set me thinking. It is about Roraima, and it is
old; that is to say, it is in an old number of a paper
bound up in this book that a friend has lent me. I
should like to read it to you. Shall I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right; if I may smoke the while. I suppose I
may?&rdquo; And the speaker, anticipating consent, pulled
out a pipe, filled and lighted it, and then, having seated
himself on a chair, crossed one leg over the other, and
added, &ldquo;Now, then, I am ready. Fire away, old man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Leonard Elwood read the following extract from
the book he had been studying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Will no one explore Roraima, and bring us back the
tidings which it has been waiting these thousands of years to
give us? One of the greatest marvels and mysteries of the
earth lies on the outskirt of one of our colonies, and we leave
the mystery unsolved, the marvel uncared for. The description
given of it (with a map and an illustrated sketch) in Mr.
Barrington Brown&rsquo;s &lsquo;Canoe and Camp Life in British Guiana&rsquo;
(one of the most fascinating books of travel the present writer
has read for a long time) is a thing to dream of by the hour.
A great table of pink and white and red sandstone, &lsquo;interbedded
with red shale,&rsquo; rises from a height of five thousand
one hundred feet above the level of the sea, two thousand
feet sheer into the sapphire tropical sky. A forest crowns it;
the highest waterfall in the world&mdash;only one, it would seem,
out of several&mdash;tumbles from its summit, two thousand feet at
one leap, three thousand more on a slope of forty-five degrees
to the bottom of the valley, broad enough to be seen thirty
miles away. Only two parties of civilised explorers have
reached the base of the table&mdash;Sir Robert Schomburgk many
years ago, and Mr. Brown and a companion in 1869<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>&mdash;each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
at different spots. Even the length of the mass has not been
determined&mdash;Mr. Brown says from eight to twelve miles.
And he cannot help speculating whether the remains of a
former creation may not be found at the top. At any rate,
there is the forest on its summit; of what trees is it composed?
They cannot well be the same as those at its base. At a
distance of fifteen hundred feet above sea-level the mango-tree
of the West Indies, which produces fruit in abundance
below, ceases to bear. The change in vegetation must be far
more decided where the difference is between five thousand
and seven thousand feet. Thus for millenniums this island of
sandstone in the South American continent must have had its
own distinct flora. What may be its fauna? Very few birds
probably ascend to a height of two thousand feet in the air,
the vulture tribe excepted. Nearly the whole of its animated
inhabitants are likely to be as distinct as its plants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it peopled with human beings? Who can tell? Why
not? The climate must be temperate, delicious. There is
abundance of water, very probably issuing from some lake on
the summit. Have we here a group of unknown brothers cut
off from all the rest of their kind?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The summit, Mr. Brown says, is inaccessible except by
means of balloons. Well, that is a question to be settled
on the spot, between an engineer and a first-rate &lsquo;Alpine.&rsquo;
(What is the satisfaction of standing on the ice-ridge of the
Matterhorn, or crossing the lava-wastes of the Vatna-Jökull,
compared to what would be the sensation of reaching that
aerial forest and gazing plumb down over the sea of tropical
verdure beneath, within an horizon the limits of which are
absolutely beyond guessing?)</p>

<p>&ldquo;But put it that a balloon is required, surely it would be
worth while for one of our learned societies to organise a
balloon expedition for the purpose. No one can tell what
problems in natural science might not be elucidated by the
exploration. We have here an area of limited extent within
which the secular variation of species, if any, must have gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
on undisturbed, with only a limited number of conceivable
exceptions, since at least the very beginning of the present
age in the world&rsquo;s life. Can there be a fairer field for the
testing of those theories which are occupying men&rsquo;s minds
so much in our days? And if there be human beings on
Roraima, what new data must not their language, their condition,
contribute for the study of philologers, anthropologists,
sociologists?</p>

<p>&ldquo;One more wonder remains to be told. The traveller
speaks of two other mountains in the same district which are
of the same description as Roraima&mdash;tables of sand-stone
rising up straight into the blue&mdash;one larger than (though not
as high as) Roraima itself. It is only because of their
existence, and because, for aught that appears, they may be
equally inaccessible with Roraima, that one does not venture
to call Roraima <em>the</em> greatest marvel and mystery of the
earth!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;What is that taken from?&rdquo; asked Jack Templemore
when the reader had put down the book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is from the <cite>Spectator</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> I say, Jack, what a chance
for an explorer! Fancy people spending their money and
risking their lives in exploring an icy, cold, miserable,
desolate region, like the Arctic Circle, when there is a
wondrous land here in the blue skies&mdash;yet no wilderness
of ice and snow&mdash;waiting to be won; and no one seems
to trouble about it! I do wish you would do as I have so
often suggested&mdash;set out with me upon an expedition
and let us see whether we cannot solve the secret of this
mysterious mountain. You have the leisure now, and I
have the money. Dr. Lorien and his son are now on
their way back from near there; if they can undertake
the journey, so could we. Besides, it is not as though we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
were novices at this kind of travel; we have been on short
trips to the interior times enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack Templemore looked dubious. He was, it is true,
used to roughing it in the wild parts of South America.
He had been trained as an engineer, and, for some years&mdash;he
was now twenty-eight&mdash;had been engaged in surveying
or pioneering for new railways in various places
on the Continent. His father having lately died and left
him and his mother very poorly off, he was now somewhat
anxiously looking about for something that would give
him permanent occupation, or the chance of making a
little money. He and Leonard Elwood were great friends;
though they were, in many respects, of very different
characters. Elwood was, essentially, of a romantic, poetic
temperament; while Templemore affected always a direct,
practical, matter-of-fact way of looking at things, as
became an engineer. He was dark, tall and sturdily
built, with keen, steady grey eyes, and a straight-forward,
good-humoured manner. Both were used to hunting,
shooting, and out-door sports, and, as Elwood had just
said, they had had many short hunting trips into the
interior together. But these had been in previous years,
since which, both had been away from Georgetown.
Templemore, as above stated, had been engaged in railway
enterprises, Elwood had gone to Europe, where, after
some time spent in England, during which his father and
mother had both died, he had travelled for a while &lsquo;to see
the world,&rsquo; and finally had come out again to Georgetown
to look after some property his father had left him. On
arrival he had gone at first to an hotel, but some old
friends of his parents, who lived on an estate known as
&lsquo;Meldona,&rsquo; had insisted upon his staying with them for
a while. Here he found that his old friend Jack Templemore
was a frequent visitor, and it was an open secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
that Maud Kingsford, elder of the two daughters of
Leonard&rsquo;s host, was the real attraction that brought him
there so constantly.</p>

<p>Now Jack Templemore, as has been said, was more
practical-minded than Leonard. He had not shrunk
from the hardships and privations of wild forest life when
engaged upon railway-engineering work, when there had
been something definite in view&mdash;money to be made,
instruction to be gained, or promotion to be hoped for.
But he did not view with enthusiasm the idea of leaving
comfortable surroundings for the discomforts of rough
travel, merely for travel&rsquo;s sake, or upon what he deemed
a sort of wild-goose chase. He had carefully read up all
the information that was obtainable concerning the mountain
Roraima, and had seen no reason to doubt the
conclusions that had been come to by those who ought to
know&mdash;that it was inaccessible. Of what use then to
spend time, trouble, money&mdash;perhaps health and strength&mdash;upon
attempting the impossible?</p>

<p>So Jack Templemore argued, and, be it said, there was
the other reason. Why should he go away and separate
himself for an indefinite period from his only surviving
parent and the girl he loved best in the world, with no
better object than a vague idea of scrambling up a
mountain that had been pronounced by practical men
unclimbable?</p>

<p>Thus, when Leonard appealed to him on this particular
morning, merely because he had come across something
that had fired his enthusiasm afresh, Jack did not respond
to the proposal with the cordiality that the other evidently
wished for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind going a short trip with you, old man,&rdquo;
Jack said presently, &ldquo;for a little hunting, if you feel
restless and are a-hungering after a spell of wandering&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
few days, or a week or two, if you like&mdash;but a long
expedition with nothing to go upon, as it were, seems to
me only next door to midsummer madness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard turned away with an air of disappointment,
and just then Maud Kingsford, who had been playing
and singing inside the room, stepped out.</p>

<p>Leonard discreetly went into the house and left the
two alone, and Maud greeted Jack with a rosy tell-tale
flush that made her pretty face look still more charming.
In appearance she was neither fair nor dark, her hair and
eyebrows being brown and her eyes hazel. She was an
unaffected, good-hearted girl, more thoughtful and serious,
perhaps, than girls of her age usually are&mdash;she was
twenty, while Stella, the younger sister, was between
eighteen and nineteen&mdash;and had shown her capacity for
managing a home by her success in that line in their own
home since her mother&rsquo;s death a few years before. The
practical-minded Jack, who had duly noted this, saw
in it additional cause for admiration; but, indeed, it
was only a natural outcome of her innate good sense.
She now asked what her lover and Leonard had been
talking of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The usual thing,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s mad to
go upon an exploring expedition; thinks we could succeed
where others have failed. It&rsquo;s so unlikely, you know.
Now, if he would only look at the thing practically&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maud burst into a merry laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do amuse me&mdash;you two,&rdquo; she exclaimed; at
which Jack looked a little disconcerted. &ldquo;<em>You</em> always
insisting so upon being strictly non-speculative, and
Leonard, with his romantic phantasies, and his dreams
and visions, and vague aspirations after castles in the
air. You are always hammering away at him, trying to
instil practical ideas into him with the same praiseworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
perseverance, though you know that in all these years
you have never made the least little bit of impression
upon him. Your ideas and his are like oil and water,
you know. They will never mix, shake them together as
you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think I am right? Isn&rsquo;t it common
sense?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite right, of course; and you <em>are</em> persevering; I&rsquo;ll
say that for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the matter of that, so&rsquo;s Leonard,&rdquo; said Jack with
a good-natured laugh. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s as persevering with this
fad of his as any man I ever met in my life. I do believe
he&rsquo;s got a fixed idea that he has only to start upon this
enterprise, and he will come back a made man with untold
and undreamt-of wealth and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a princess for a bride&mdash;the fair maid of his
dreams,&rdquo; Maud put in, still laughing. &ldquo;We have not heard
so much of her, by the bye, lately. He has been rather
shy of those things since his return from Europe, and does
not like to be spoken to about them. We began to think
he had grown out of his youthful fancies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fact was, that, from his childhood, Leonard had
been accustomed to strange dreams and fancies. These
five&mdash;Leonard, Templemore, and Mr. Kingsford&rsquo;s son and
two daughters&mdash;had been children together, and in those
days Leonard had talked freely to his childish companions
of all his imaginative ideas; and as they grew older, he had
not varied much in this respect. Moreover, Leonard had
had an Indian nurse, named Carenna, who had encouraged
him in his fantastic dreamings, and who had, by her Indian
folk-lore tales, early excited his imagination. Her son
Matava, too, had been Leonard&rsquo;s constant companion
almost so long as he could remember, first in all sorts of
boyish games and amusements, and later in his hunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
expeditions; and both Matava and Carenna had been
always more devoted to Leonard than even to his father
and mother.</p>

<p>But when Mr. and Mrs. Elwood left the estate they had
been cultivating, to go to England, the two Indians had
gone away into the interior to live at an Indian settlement
with their own tribe. About twice a year, however&mdash;or
even oftener, if there were occasion&mdash;Matava still came
down to the coast upon some little trading expedition with
other Indians; and at such times he never failed to come
to see the Kingsfords and inquire after Leonard.</p>

<p>The Dr. Lorien, of whom mention had been made by
Leonard, was a retired medical practitioner who had turned
botanist and orchid-collector. He had been a ship&rsquo;s doctor,
and in that capacity had voyaged pretty well all over the
world. Since he had given that up he had travelled
further still by land&mdash;in the tropical regions in the heart
of Africa, in Siam, the Malay Peninsular and, latterly, in
South America&mdash;in search of orchids and other rare floral
and botanical specimens. The vicinity of Roraima being
one of the most remarkable in the world for such things&mdash;though
so difficult of access as to be but seldom visited by
white men&mdash;it is not surprising that he had lately planned
a journey thither.</p>

<p>From this journey the doctor and his son were now
daily expected back. One of the Indians of their party had,
indeed, already arrived, having been despatched in advance,
a few days before, to announce their safe return.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that Templemore and Maud, while
still talking, were not greatly surprised at the sudden
appearance of Matava, who stated that he had come down
with the doctor&rsquo;s party, who would follow very quickly
on his heels.</p>

<p>Maud, who knew the Indian and his mother well, received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
him kindly; and, to his great delight, was able to
inform him that his &lsquo;young master&rsquo;&mdash;as he always
called Leonard Elwood&mdash;had returned to Georgetown, and
was at present with them.</p>

<p>Matava had, indeed, expected this, for he had heard
of Leonard&rsquo;s intention at his last visit to the coast some
six months before. He was greatly pleased to find he
was not to be disappointed in his expectation. Moreover,
the Indian declared, he had news for him&mdash;&ldquo;news of the
greatest importance&rdquo;&mdash;and begged to be allowed to see
him at once. So Maud sent him into the house&mdash;where
he knew his way about perfectly&mdash;to find Leonard; and
then, turning to Templemore, she said, laughing,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what his &lsquo;important&rsquo; intelligence can be?
Some deeper secret than usual that his old nurse has to
tell him, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s nothing likely to rouse a further desire
to set off on this mad-cap expedition he has so long had
in his mind,&rdquo; Templemore returned; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; looking at her
with a sigh, &ldquo;if he <em>should</em> make up his mind to start, I
am, in effect, pledged to go too, whether I wish or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should you expect it? and how are you obliged
to go?&rdquo; Maud inquired with evident uneasiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that Leonard saw Dr. Lorien in London
before he came out last, and had a long talk with him.
When he learned of the expedition upon which the doctor
was then setting out, he was much annoyed at being
unable to join him. He said, however, that he should be
in Georgetown himself in a few months, and hoped to see
the doctor on his return; and he particularly asked him
to try to collect for him all the information and particulars
he could concerning the best route by which to make the
journey to Roraima. Dr. Lorien told me all this before
he left us, adding that he felt certain Leonard&rsquo;s object in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
coming again to Georgetown was quite as much to arrange
for an expedition as his ostensible one of looking after
his property. And <em>I</em> know, too, from what I have seen
since Leonard has been back, that his thoughts are full
of the idea. You say he does not now talk much of it to
you or to others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; and as I told you just now, we had begun rather
to think he had given up his former romantic yearnings
for adventure; and, when you have referred to them before
him, I have thought that you were only teasing him
a little about old times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear no; by no means. Whatever he may say,
or leave unsaid to you and his general acquaintances, he
is, in his heart, just as much set upon it as ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is odd, that,&rdquo; Maud observed thoughtfully, &ldquo;because
he used to be so fond of telling us about his dreams and
visions and all the castles in the air and half-mystical
imaginings he used to build upon them. But,&rdquo; she went
on slowly, &ldquo;I have noticed that, since his long absence
from us, Leonard Elwood is very different from what he
was as I remember him. He seems, at times, so reserved
and distant, I almost feel inclined to call him &lsquo;Mr.
Elwood&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;Leonard.&rsquo; And he is, in a manner,
unsociable, too. He is so preoccupied always, so silent,
and so wrapped up in himself, that you generally have to
wait, if you speak to him, while he collects his thoughts&mdash;brings
them back from the distant skies or wherever they
have gone a-wandering&mdash;before he replies to you. Not
that he is intentionally cool or distant, I think; and I am
sure he is just as good-hearted as ever. Yet there <em>is</em> a
change of some sort. Stella says the same. And, do
you know, he sometimes gives me a sort of feeling as
though he were not English at all, but of some other race,
and that he feels half out-of-place amongst us, a fish out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of water, as it were? I wonder whether he is in love!&rdquo;
And Maud gave a ringing little laugh.</p>

<p>Templemore shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he were, it would be with some young lady on the
other side of the Atlantic,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;And he would
not be desirous of prolonging his stay on this side. No;
<em>I</em> know what is the matter with him. He talks freely
enough to me. And, now that he is expecting Dr. Lorien
back, he is gradually working himself up into a state of
excitement and expectation. He has quite made up his
mind for some news or information&mdash;Heaven only knows
why&mdash;and that is what makes him by turns restless and
preoccupied. If, therefore, what Matava has to tell has
anything to do with what I know to be so much in his
thoughts, it may be the means of deciding him to go; and
then I should have to go too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why? I don&rsquo;t see what it has to do with you,
Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has this to do with me, dear Maud,&rdquo; said Templemore,
taking her hand; &ldquo;Leonard, some time ago, made
me a very handsome&mdash;to me a very tempting&mdash;offer if I
would make up my mind to start with him on this vague
expedition. He offered me £300 clear, he paying all
expenses, and giving me, besides, half of whatever came
out of it. Unfortunately for myself, I am not now in a
position to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to such an offer. I have been, now,
nearly a year waiting for something to &lsquo;turn up.&rsquo; My
mother has barely enough to live on, and depends upon
me for ordinary comforts, to say nothing of little luxuries;
and what I had saved up from former engagements is
steadily getting less and less, and will shortly disappear.
I do wish with all my heart I could get anything else,
almost, rather than this wild-goose affair of Leonard&rsquo;s.
Yet nothing has offered itself; so what am I to do? For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
your sake, for the hope of being able one day to provide a
home for you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Jack,&rdquo; Maud interposed, with a deep flush, &ldquo;do
not say for <em>my</em> sake. I would not have you set out on
an enterprise of danger and difficulty for my sake. But
I see clearly enough you must do it, if it be again offered,
for your mother&rsquo;s sake. Yes, for hers, you must.&rdquo; The
girl hesitated, and it was easy to see she found it hard to
say the words, but she went on bravely, &ldquo;So, I repeat, if it
be again offered, you must accept it, Jack. And be sure I
will look after your mother, and comfort her while you
are away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is spoken like my own dear girl,&rdquo; Templemore
answered with emotion. &ldquo;Yes, I cannot well refuse;
and I know I may look to you to console my mother.
You will comfort each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then they heard Leonard&rsquo;s voice calling out in
excited tones for Templemore. A moment or two later
he came rushing out of the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack, Jack!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Such a strange thing!
Here is our opportunity! Matava has brought some
extraordinary news!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard was so incoherent in his excitement, that it
was some time before his hearers grasped his meaning.</p>

<p>His news amounted, in effect, to this. A white man
had been staying for some time near the Indian village at
which Carenna and her son Matava lived; and he had
had many talks with both about a project for ascending
the mountain of Roraima. It being an arduous undertaking,
he sought the co-operation of one or two other
white men; and Leonard&rsquo;s old nurse had urged him to
communicate with her young master, who would shortly
be in Georgetown, assuring him that he would be the very
one&mdash;from the interest and enthusiasm he would feel&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
join him and help him to achieve success if success were
possible. Matava, who knew of Dr. Lorien&rsquo;s presence in
the district, had suggested to the stranger to go to see
him, and a meeting had thus been brought about. The
doctor would tell him the result; but the main thing was
that the stranger had sent an invitation to Leonard to join
him and to bring, if he pleased, one other white man, but
no more. The doctor was now at the Settlement, near
the mouth of the Essequibo, transferring to the steamer,
from the Indian canoes in which they had been brought
down the river, his botanical treasures and other trophies
of his journey. If Leonard wished to go back with the
canoes and the Indians who were with them, he would
have to let them know at once, and they would wait.
Otherwise they would be on their way back in a day or
two; which would involve the organising of a fresh
expedition&mdash;a matter of great trouble&mdash;should Leonard
make up his mind to proceed later.</p>

<p>The enthusiastic Leonard needed no time to make up
his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall go,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If you will come too, Jack, I
shall be only too glad. But, if not, I may be able to find
some one else; or I shall go alone. So I shall send word
at once to keep the boats and the Indians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; objected Maud Kingsford, &ldquo;consider! You
know nothing of this stranger; he may be a blackleg,
an escaped murderer or desperado, or all sorts of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no! Carenna knows. She has sent word that
I can trust this man, and she knows. She is too fond
of me to let me get mixed up with any doubtful character.
Dr. Lorien, too, and Harry have seen him, and talked
with him, and think well of him; so Matava says. I shall
know more when I see them in a day or two. Meantime,
I shall keep the canoes and Indians, and risk it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he rushed off to have a further talk with Matava,
and, as he said, see about getting the Indian &ldquo;some
grub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack and Maud, left alone, looked at each other in
dismay. It had been one thing to talk vaguely of what
they would do in case Leonard should take what at the
time seemed a very unlikely step. It was quite another
to be thus suddenly brought face to face with it.</p>

<p>Maud turned very pale and seemed about to faint. She
felt keenly how hard it would be to see her lover depart
upon an adventure of this uncertain character, the end
or duration of which no one could even guess at. But
she recovered her self-possession with an effort and,
looking steadily at Templemore, said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you said you would do for our sakes is to be
very quickly put to the test, it seems. You&mdash;will&mdash;go,
Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered firmly; &ldquo;since it is your wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It is hard to lose you;
it will be hard for us both. But go&mdash;and go with a good
heart. Be sure I will be a daughter to your mother
while you are away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took her hand in his and pressed it to his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For your sake, dear Maud, I shall go,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;For your sake and for my mother&rsquo;s; in the hope that
some success may result; but not&mdash;Heaven knows&mdash;for
the mere sordid hope of gain.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="f8">MONELLA.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Two</span> days later Dr. Lorien and his son arrived in
Georgetown and, after taking rooms at the Kaieteur
Hotel, went at once to call upon the Kingsfords. This
haste was, in reality, prompted by Harry, whose thoughts
were bent upon his hopes of once more seeing the pretty
Stella; but the ostensible reason that he urged upon his
father was somewhat different, and had to do with the
message of which they were the bearers from the white
stranger they had met in their travels.</p>

<p>At the evening dinner the matter was discussed, Mr.
Kingsford and his son Robert and the others being present.</p>

<p>The two travellers had much to tell of their adventures,
which had been full of both interest and danger, apart
from the matter of the stranger&rsquo;s message.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet, I think,&rdquo; observed the doctor, thoughtfully,
&ldquo;our meeting with this stranger, and his behaviour, impressed
me more than almost all else that happened to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How so? What is he like?&rdquo; asked Mr. Kingsford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In figure he is very tall; of a most commanding
stature and appearance. <em>I</em> am not short.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you are over six feet!&rdquo; put in Harry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet I almost think, if he had held his arm
straight out, I could have walked under it with my hat
on, and without stooping.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you could, dad,&rdquo; Harry corroborated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to age&mdash;there I confess myself at sea. As a
doctor I am accustomed to judge of age; yet he thoroughly
puzzled me. If I could believe in the possibility of a
man&rsquo;s being a hundred and fifty years old and yet
remaining strong and hale and vigorous, I should not be
surprised if he had claimed that age. On the other hand,
if one could believe in a young, stalwart, muscular man
of thirty with the face and white hair of an old-looking,
but not <em>very</em> old man, then I could have believed it if I
had been told he was no more than thirty. In fact, he
was a complete puzzle to me; a mystery. But the most
remarkable thing about him was the expression of his
eyes; they were the most extraordinary I have ever seen
in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wild&mdash;mad-looking?&rdquo; Templemore asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, by no means; quite the reverse. Very steady
and piercing; but wonderfully fascinating. Mild and
kind-looking to a fault; and yet changing to a look of
quiet, almost stern resolution that had in it nothing hard,
or cruel, or disagreeable. In fact, I hardly know how to
describe that look, or convey an idea of it, except by
saying that it was something between the gaze of a lion
and that of a Newfoundland dog. It had all the majesty,
the magnanimity, the conscious power of the one, with
the benevolence and wistful kindness and affection of the
other. Never have I seen such an expression. I really did
not know the human countenance could express the mingled
characteristics one seemed to read so plainly in his&mdash;all
kindly, all noble, all suggestive of sincerity and integrity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>are</em> enthusiastic!&rdquo; said Robert, laughing.</p>

<p>The old doctor coloured up a little; then took out his
handkerchief and wiped his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it sounds strange to hear an old man of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
world like me speak so forcibly about a man&rsquo;s appearance,&rdquo;
he returned; &ldquo;but, if it is true, I do not see why I should
not say it. Ask Harry here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off his face,&rdquo; Harry declared.
&ldquo;He fairly fascinated me. I felt I should have to do anything
he told me; even to taking my pistol and killing
the first person I met. I do believe I should have done
it&mdash;or any other out-of-the way thing. And he made you
feel, too, as though you liked him so, that you longed to do
any mortal thing you could to please him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; asked Templemore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monella.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monella? Is that all? No other name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None that I heard. And as to his nationality, I
cannot even so much as guess. I have been in Central
Africa, in Siam, in India, in China, in Russia, and have
picked up a smattering of the languages of those countries;
but this man jabbered away in all; additionally, he spoke
French, German, Spanish and Portuguese, besides English.
So much I know. How many more he speaks I can&rsquo;t
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Injun,&rdquo; said Harry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I forgot that. We had some of three different
tribes with us, and he spoke to each in his own tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is his object in going in for this Roraima
exploration?&rdquo; asked Mr. Kingsford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has a curious theory. He declares that the
ancient island-city of El Dorado&mdash;or Manoa&mdash;was not at
the lower end or part of the Pacaraima mountains, as
some have surmised, but at the further and highest point
of the range, which is Roraima itself. He holds that the
great lake or inland sea of Parima once washed around
the bases of all those mountains, making islands of what
are now their summits; and that the highest and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
inaccessible of all, Roraima, was selected by the Manoans
for their fastness, and for the site of their wonderful
&lsquo;Golden City.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that theory won&rsquo;t help him to get up there, will
it?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but there is something else. He states that he
was brought up by some people, the last members of what
had once been a nation, but has now died out. They
lived in a secluded valley high up on the slopes of the
Andes. He has travelled all over the world, and went
back to these friends of his, only to find that they were all
dead, save one, and that he was fast dying. This survivor
gave him an ancient parchment with plans and diagrams,
by means of which, it was declared, the top of the
mountain can be reached, where will be found whatever
traces may be left of the famous city of Manoa or El
Dorado. This man, Monella, has other old parchments
which he can read, but I could not&mdash;he showed me some&mdash;and
from these he declared his belief that there is
almost unlimited wealth to be gained by those who find
the site of this wonderful city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this time Leonard had been listening with sparkling
eyes and flushed cheeks, though in silence. Here he
glanced with a satisfied smile at Templemore, and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s method in all that; at all events he is not
undertaking the thing in a haphazard way and without
something to go upon, that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack did not look hopeful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is probably just as wild and hopeless an adventure
all the same,&rdquo; was his reply. &ldquo;What &lsquo;directions&rsquo; or
&lsquo;plans&rsquo; or &lsquo;diagrams&rsquo; can help a man to-day after the
lapse of hundreds and hundreds of years&mdash;even if they
were reliable, and the old party who handed them over
was not mad&mdash;as he probably was?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As to Monella,&rdquo; observed the doctor, &ldquo;I could see no
sign of madness in him. He is one of the most intelligent,
best-informed men I ever met. I cannot say anything,
of course, of his informant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he any money, do you suppose&mdash;this man?&rdquo;
Robert asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But he pays the Indians well, and has
got together a lot of stores, it seems; which must have
been a costly thing to do. They have been brought over
the mountains from Brazil. And he specially said you
need not trouble to load yourself up with much in the
way of stores&mdash;only sufficient to get to him. After that
you will be all right. And he said nothing about money
being wanted. But,&rdquo; and here the doctor hesitated, &ldquo;he
is very particular as to the character and disposition of
those he purposes to work with. In fact, he subjected me
to a long sort of cross-examination respecting our friend
Leonard here. He had already gained a lot of information
about him from the old Indian nurse, it seemed, and I
was surprised at the details he had picked up and remembered.
In fact, Master Leonard,&rdquo; continued the doctor,
addressing the young man, &ldquo;he seemed to know you
almost as well as if he had lived with you for years. And
your friend Mr. Templemore, too, he seemed to know
about him, and to expect that he would join you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could that be?&rdquo; Jack demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, from the old nurse and Matava, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To tell you the honest truth,&rdquo; Harry interposed, &ldquo;I
believe there&rsquo;s some hocus-pocus business about those
two. She is reputed to be a witch, you know; not a bad
witch, but a good sort. And I quite believe Monella to
be a wizard; also of a good sort. And when those two
laid their heads together, they could know a lot between
them, I suspect. I should not at all wonder if he were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
not magician enough to lead you to the &lsquo;golden castle,&rsquo;
or &lsquo;city,&rsquo; or whatever it is, and find its hidden stores of
gold. I wish I had a chance to join him. But dad&rsquo;s
wanting me somewhere else. So I am out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; observed his father. &ldquo;We have to go on to
Rio, where I have some law business on. But we shall
not be away a great while, and then we are going back to
that district.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going back?&rdquo; said Templemore in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is a lot to be done there. It is a wonderful
place for my sort of work, and we really saw but very
little of it after all. So we are going again when we return
from Rio; but I cannot at all tell when that may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor was a fine-looking specimen of a hardy,
bronzed traveller. He was, as has been said, over six feet
in height; his hair and beard were iron-grey, his complexion
was a little florid beneath its tan, and his expression
good-humoured and often jovial. His son, Harry, was
somewhat slight in build, but wiry, and had been used to
knocking about with his father. He was a young fellow
with boundless animal spirits and plenty of pluck and
courage. His ready kindness to every one made him a
general favourite; and the lively, captivating Stella and he
were special friends.</p>

<p>Mr. Kingsford asked the doctor whether any time had
been estimated for the length of the expedition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be difficult,&rdquo; Dr. Lorien answered.
&ldquo;Apart from the long and tedious journey there, there is
the girdle of forest that surrounds Roraima to be cut
through. That may take months, I am told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Months!&rdquo; The exclamation came from Maud who,
with Stella, had been a silent but appreciative listener.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. It is a curious thing, but this forest belt is never
approached even by any of the Indian tribes. They look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
upon it with superstitious awe and will not even go near
it. Indeed, they all regard Roraima with a sort of horror.
They declare there is a lake on the top guarded by demons
and large white eagles, and that it will never be gazed on by
mortal eyes; that in the forest that surrounds it are
monstrous serpents&mdash;&lsquo;camoodis&rsquo; they call them&mdash;larger
far than any to be found elsewhere in the land; besides
these, there are &lsquo;didis&rsquo;, gigantic man-apes, bigger and
more ferocious and formidable than the African gorilla.
Altogether, this wood has a very bad reputation, and no
Indian will venture near it. Indeed, the mountain of
Roraima and all its surroundings are looked upon as
weird and uncanny. As a former traveller has expressed
it, &lsquo;its very name has come to be surrounded by a halo
of dread and indefinable fear.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How, then, is the necessary road to be made through
this promising bit of woodland?&rdquo; asked Templemore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>There</em> has been Monella&rsquo;s difficulty,&rdquo; returned the
doctor. &ldquo;But for that, doubtless, he would not have
troubled about any one else&rsquo;s joining him. But, though he
is very popular amongst the Indians, they cannot get over
their fear of the &lsquo;demons&rsquo;&rsquo; wood, as they call it. They
are, in fact, quite devoted to him, for he has done much
that has made him both loved and feared&mdash;as one must
always be to gain the real devotion of these people. He
has effected many wonderful cures amongst them, I was
told; but, more than that, he has saved the lives of two
or three by acts of great personal courage. So that, at
last, he even prevailed upon them to enter the &lsquo;haunted
wood&rsquo; with him. But they are making very little progress,
it appears; he cannot keep them together, and they
give way to panic at the slightest thing and make a bolt
of it; then he has to go hunting over the country for
them, and it takes days to get them together again&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
so on. He is in hopes that the presence and example of
other white men will inspire them with greater confidence
and courage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A promising and inviting outlook, I must say,&rdquo; said
Jack, eyeing Leonard gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Leonard exclaimed with enthusiasm.
&ldquo;If he can face it, so can we; and if it is good enough
for him to brave such difficulties, it is good enough for us.
It only shows what sterling stuff he must be made of!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Jack gave a sort of grunt that was clearly far
from implying assent to Leonard&rsquo;s view of the matter.</p>

<p>There was further talk, but it added little to the information
given above; and, inasmuch as Leonard had
already made up his mind, almost in advance, and had
to ask no one&rsquo;s permission but his own, he determined at
once to set about the necessary preparations; and Jack
Templemore&mdash;though with evident reluctance&mdash;agreed to
accompany him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a list of all the things I took with me,&rdquo;
remarked Dr. Lorien, &ldquo;and notes of a few that I afterwards
found would have been useful and that I consequently
regretted I had not taken; and also some specially suggested
by the stranger Monella. You had better copy
them all out carefully, for you will find it will save you
a lot of time and trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus it came about that in less than a week their preparations
were all made, and the two, with Matava as
guide, were ready to set out. Matava had with him
fourteen or fifteen Indians, who had formed the doctor&rsquo;s
party, and these, and the canoes with the stores on board,
were soon after waiting at the Settlement, ready to make
a start.</p>

<p>Then, one sunny day at the beginning of the dry
season, the Kingsfords, with Mrs. Templemore, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
doctor and his son, all took the steamer to the &ldquo;Penal
Settlement&rdquo; (a place a few miles inside the mouth of the
Essequibo river, the starting place of all such parties),
to see the young men off and wish them God speed.
When it came to this point the struggle was a hard one
for Maud and for Templemore&rsquo;s mother; but they bore
themselves bravely&mdash;outwardly at least. The three canoes
put off amidst much fluttering of handkerchiefs, and soon
all that could be seen of the adventurers were three small
specks, gradually growing less and less, as the boats
made their way up the bosom of the great Essequibo
river&mdash;here some eight miles in width. Their intended
journey had been kept more or less a secret; such had
been the wish of him they were going to join. Hence no
outside friends had accompanied the party to see them off.
Those who knew of their going away thought they were
only bent upon a hunting trip of a little longer duration
than usual.</p>

<p>For two loving hearts left behind the separation was a
trying one. For a few days Mrs. Templemore stayed on
at &lsquo;Meldona&rsquo; with Maud, and the presence of Dr.
Lorien and the vivacious Harry helped to cheer them
somewhat; but, when the doctor and his son started for
Rio, the others returned sadly to the routine of their
everyday life, with many anxious speculations and forebodings

<span class="f8">THE JOURNEY FROM THE COAST.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> greater part of the interior of British Guiana
consists of dense forests which are mostly unexplored.
No roads traverse them, and but little would be
known of the savannas, or open grassy plains, and the
mountains that lie beyond&mdash;and they would indeed be
inaccessible&mdash;were it not for the many wide rivers by
which the forests are intersected. These form the only
means of communication between the coast and the
interior at the present day; and so vast is the extent of
territory covered with forest growth that it is probable
many years will elapse before any road communication
is opened up between the sea and the open country lying
beyond the woods.</p>

<p>Of these vast forests little&mdash;or rather practically nothing&mdash;is
known save what can be seen of them from the
rivers by those voyaging to and fro in canoes. There are
a limited number of spots at which the Indians of the
savannas come to the banks of the rivers to launch their
canoes when journeying to the coast; and to reach these
places they have what are known as &lsquo;Indian paths&rsquo;
through the intervening woods. These so-called paths
are, for the most part, of such a character, however, that
only Indians accustomed to them can find their way by
them. Any white man who should venture to trust
himself alone in them would inevitably get quickly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
hopelessly lost. Hence&mdash;save for a few miles near the
line of coast&mdash;there are, as yet, absolutely no roads in the
country.</p>

<p>Naturally, under such conditions, the forest scenery is
of the wildest imaginable character, and its flora and fauna
flourish unchecked in the utmost luxuriance of tropical
savage life; for the country lies but a few degrees from
the equator, and is far more sparsely populated than even
the surrounding tropical regions of Brazil and Venezuela.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, for those who for any reason
have occasion to traverse this wild region, there is no lack
of water-ways. Several grand rivers of great breadth
lead from the coast in different directions, most of them
being navigable (for canoes and small boats) for great
distances, leaving only comparatively short stretches of
forest land to be crossed by travellers desiring to reach
the open plains and hills.</p>

<p>Of these rivers, the Essequibo is one of the finest, and
it was by this route that the two friends, Elwood and
Templemore, set out, under Matava&rsquo;s guidance, to reach
their destination. From this river they branched off into
one of its affluents, the Potaro, noted for its wonderful
waterfall, the Kaieteur, which they visited <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i>. Here
their canoes were left and exchanged for lighter ones,
hired from the Ackawoi Indians, who live at a little
distance above the fall; their stores and camp equipage
being carried round. So far the journey had been uneventful,
save for a little excitement in passing the various
cataracts and rapids; but the two young men knew their
way fairly well thus far, having visited the Kaieteur with
Matava some years before.</p>

<p>When, however, the journey was resumed above the
Kaieteur, the route was new to them; and, among the
first things they noticed, were the alligators with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the river abounded. In the Essequibo they had seen
none, and not many below the fall; but from this point,
as far as they ascended the river, they saw them continually.
Once they had a narrow escape. They were
making arrangements for camping on the bank, and were
nearing the shore in the last of the canoes, when a tremendous
blow and a great splash overturned the boat,
and they found themselves struggling in the stream. An
alligator had struck the canoe a blow with its tail and
upset it. Fortunately, however, it was in shallow water;
and the Indians, seeing how matters were, made a great
splashing, and thus frightened away the reptile. The
contents of the canoe were partly recovered, not without
difficulty; but some were damaged by the water.</p>

<p>As they proceeded up the river, the rapids and cataracts
became more frequent, and the negotiation of them more
difficult, till they reached a spot where further navigation
was impossible, and they had to take to the forest, their stores
and baggage being henceforward carried by the Indians.</p>

<p>This marked the commencement of the really arduous
part of the journey. So long as the stores were carried
in the boats, the Indians had been cheerful and docile,
and easy to manage. But now their work was harder,
and food was scarcer&mdash;for game is difficult to shoot in
the forest. Then, after two or three days, the gloom of
the woods began to have an evident effect upon their
spirits; they first became depressed, and then began to
grumble. This would not have been of so much consequence,
perhaps, but that Matava became apprehensive
that they might desert. They were not people of his tribe,
it seemed; they had come with Dr. Lorien from a different
district; and when they began to understand that
the eventual destination was Roraima, they became still
more depressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>All the Indian tribes who have heard of Roraima, in
any way, have the same superstitious dread of it; and
those now with the two young men were evidently not
exceptional in this respect. Templemore and Elwood
began to feel anxious and, to make matters worse, food
ran short for the Indians. The latter live chiefly on the
native food, a kind of bread called cassava, and, of this,
a good deal of what they had brought with them had been
lost or spoiled by the upsetting of the canoe.</p>

<p>In consequence, Matava advised that they should
interrupt their direct journey to turn aside to an Indian
settlement that he knew of, about a day&rsquo;s journey off the
route they were pursuing; there they would be able to
replenish their stores, he thought; and to this course a
reluctant assent was given by the two friends.</p>

<p>It turned out to be more than a day&rsquo;s journey, however;
but they reached the place on the second day. It was
called Karalang; there were not more than a dozen huts,
and the people at first said that they had no food to spare;
but eventually promised to procure some if the travellers
would wait a few days; and this they were perforce compelled
to do.</p>

<p>This village was situated on a hill in a piece of open
country in the midst of the great forest; and, during their
enforced rest, the two friends were enabled to engage in
a little hunting, and to see more of the wild life of the
woods than they had seen before.</p>

<p>The first thing they did on arrival was to procure a
couple of fowls for cooking, of which there were plenty in
the village. But these were of no use as food for the
Indians, who never eat them. Throughout the country
this is everywhere the case; the Indians keep fowls, yet
never eat them; and it is said that, were it not for the
vampire bats and tiger-cats, these would increase beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
all reason. Though, however, they object to fowls as
a diet, they have no dislike to fish, and they were not
long in discovering that there were some in a stream that
ran near the village; and a supply was caught by their
method of poisoning the fish in such a way that they float
on top of the water as if dead, but are nevertheless
palatable and wholesome as food. The poison is prepared
from a root.</p>

<p>Amongst the miscellaneous stores the two had brought
they had a liberal supply of firearms&mdash;five Winchester
rifles, half-a-dozen revolvers and two guns, each with
double barrels, one for shot and the other for ball. The
extra weapons were in case of loss or accident, and
Templemore had a good stock of tobacco, for he never
felt happy for long together without his pipe.</p>

<p>On their way up they had had very little shooting.
Jack had indeed killed an alligator, by way of relieving
his feelings after the upsetting of the canoe; but there
had been very little time to spare for sport. Every morning
they had started as soon as the morning meal had
been eaten, and had gone into camp at night only in time
to cook a meal before it became dark. For in this part
of the world night closes in at about half-past six on the
shortest days of the year, and a little before seven on the
longest. Practically, therefore, the varying seasons bring
little difference in the length of the days. One cannot
there get up at three or four o&rsquo;clock and &ldquo;have a good
long day,&rdquo; with an evening keeping light till eight and nine
o&rsquo;clock, as in summer-time in Europe. Hence the days
seem short for travel and sport, and the nights very long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve stuck to it pretty well,&rdquo; Jack observed
in the evening, as he sat smoking by the camp fire, outside
their tent&mdash;for though the day had been hot the
evening was chilly&mdash;&ldquo;and we deserve a rest. So it is just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
as well. We will have two or three days&rsquo; shooting, and
a look round, before we go on to tackle &lsquo;the old man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The old man&rsquo; was the one they were on their way to
see&mdash;the one Dr. Lorien had met and described so enthusiastically.
Jack was a little sceptical as to whether the
good-natured doctor had not sacrificed strict accuracy to
his friendly feeling for the stranger. Leonard, too, felt
full of curiosity upon the same point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can scarcely believe, you know,&rdquo; Jack continued, &ldquo;that
our friend will turn out all that the doctor pictured him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad if he does, at any rate,&rdquo; Leonard made
reply. &ldquo;He would be almost worth coming to see for
himself alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather stretching a point, I think. However,
I am keeping an open mind on the subject. The gentleman
shall have &lsquo;a fair field and no favour,&rsquo; so far as my
judgment of him goes. I won&rsquo;t let myself be prejudiced
in advance, either one way or the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the following days they enriched their stores by
the skin of a fine jaguar, shot by Templemore, a great
boa-constrictor&mdash;or &lsquo;camoodi&rsquo;&mdash;twenty-four feet long,
shot by Leonard, and many trophies of lesser account.
Then, a fresh lot of cassava having been procured for
the Indians, the journey was resumed.</p>

<p>In about three weeks from the time of their start, the
party emerged from the forest into a more open country,
where rolling savannas alternated with patches of woodland.
Here the air was fresher and more bracing, so
that the depressing effect of the gloomy forest was soon
thrown off. They could shoot a little game, too, as they
went along; there were splendid views to be had from
the tops of the ridges and low hills they crossed. The
ground steadily rose and became first hilly and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
mountainous, till, having crossed a broad, undulating
plateau, they once more entered a forest region, but this
time of different character. The trees were farther apart;
there were hills, and rocky ravines, and mountain torrents,
steep mountains, and deep valleys. The way became
toilsome and difficult; game was scarce, or at least not
easy to obtain, owing to the nature of the ground; the
cassava ran short, and, once more, grumbling arose and
trouble threatened.</p>

<p>At last, one evening, Matava, with perplexity in his
face, led the two young men aside to hold a consultation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These people,&rdquo; he said in his own language, &ldquo;say
they will not go any farther!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far do you reckon we are now from your own
village?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About four days. If we could but persuade them to
keep on for two days more, we could fix a camp, and I
could go on alone and bring back some of my own people
to take all the things on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! a good idea, Matava. Well, let us see what
persuasion will effect. Any way, we had better get them
to go as far as we can, and then encamp at the first likely
camping-ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the end the Indians were prevailed upon, by promise
of extra pay, to go the additional two days&rsquo; journey.
Beyond that they would not budge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They think that mountain over there in the distance
is Roraima,&rdquo; Matava explained; &ldquo;and I cannot get them
to believe it isn&rsquo;t. And they are frightened, and won&rsquo;t
go any nearer to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was, therefore, nothing to be done but to adopt
Matava&rsquo;s suggestion. It was agreed that the two friends
would stay in camp and keep guard over their belongings,
while he started next day for his village, to bring help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The spot was a convenient one in which to camp for
a few days, with a stream of water near. That evening,
therefore, the Indians were paid, this being done in silver,
which they knew how to make use of. The next morning,
when Elwood and Templemore got out of their
hammocks, they found they were alone with Matava.
All the others had disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ungrateful beggars!&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;They might, at
least, have gone in a respectable manner, and not like
thieves slinking away. Let&rsquo;s hope they are not thieves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But they were not. An examination showed that
nothing had been stolen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor fellows were only frightened,&rdquo; Leonard
observed. &ldquo;They are honest enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matava, meantime, was making ready to set off alone
for carriers from his own village. When he was ready,
Templemore expressed a desire to walk a little way on the
road with him &lsquo;to take a peep over that little ridge
yonder&rsquo;; which is a wish common to travellers in a
country that is new to them. But when they reached the
ridge, there was only to be seen another short expanse
of undulating savanna, whereupon Jack decided to return,
leaving Matava to continue on his way.</p>

<p>Leonard, left to himself, finished the occupation he had
in hand&mdash;the cleaning of his double-barrel&mdash;and, having
loaded it, strolled out of the camp in another direction, to
take a look round. He left the camp to itself, not intending
to go far, and expecting that his friend would be back
in a quarter of an hour or so. Not far away a &lsquo;bell-bird&rsquo;
was ringing out its strange cry, that has been compared
by travellers to the sound of a convent bell. He had
heard these birds often in the forest since leaving the
boats, but, in consequence of the density of the woods,
had never been able to get near one. Here, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
trees were more open, there seemed to be a better
chance, and he followed, as he thought, the sound. But
soon he came to the conclusion that he had been in error;
or the bird had flown across unseen; for the direction of
the sound seemed to have changed. He, therefore, turned
off towards where he fancied the bird now was; and this
happened several times, till at last he became confused
and found he had fairly lost his way. It is a peculiarity
of the &lsquo;bell-bird,&rsquo; as it is of many other birds of the
forest, that their notes are often misleading; it is one
of those cases of what has been termed by naturalists
&lsquo;Ventriloquism in Nature,&rsquo; many examples of which the
traveller in these wild regions comes across. Leonard
had arrived at the head of a small glen, and found himself
on a grassy bank beside a little stream, sheltered from the
glare of the sun by over-hanging branches. He laid
down his gun and went to take a drink of the inviting
limpid water, and then sat awhile on the bank looking
down the picturesque ravine. It was very quiet and
peaceful all around, and he fell into one of his day-dreams.
At such times the minutes pass on unheeded; and he sat
for a long while oblivious of all that went on about him.
But presently, behind him, a silent, cunning enemy crept
up unseen and unheard till near enough for a spring; then
there was a loud roar, and the next moment Leonard was
lying on the ground in the grasp of an enormous jaguar.</p>

<p>For a minute or two the beast stood over him growling,
but not touching him after the first blow that had knocked
him down; while Leonard lay dazed and helpless, with
just enough consciousness to have a vague idea that the
best thing he could do, for the moment, was to lie perfectly
still. Then, with another roar, the animal seized him by
the shoulder and began to drag him down the slope
towards some bushes. At that moment Leonard, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
face was turned away from the brute, saw, like one in a
dream, the undergrowth through which he himself had
come, part asunder and three figures appear. Two of
them were Templemore and Matava, who stood rooted to
the spot with horror-stricken faces; the third was a tall
stranger who towered above the other two, and who also
stood still for a second or two eyeing the scene, while the
jaguar growled threateningly.</p>

<p>Then the tall stranger advanced, and the animal released
its hold and was itself seized and pulled from over Leonard.
In another moment he felt himself lifted in two giant arms,
and, looking up, saw the stranger bending upon him a
gaze in which there seemed a world of tender anxiety and
compassion. Everything appeared to swim around him,
and he knew that consciousness was leaving him; yet, for
a space, the fascination of that look seemed to hold him
chained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;must&mdash;be&mdash;Monella!&rdquo; he said, softly. Then
he fainted.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="f8">THE FIRST VIEW OF RORAIMA.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> Leonard came to himself sufficiently to see
and understand what was going on around him,
for the moment he thought himself once more in his
days of childhood; for the first face he recognised was
Carenna&rsquo;s, his Indian nurse, who was bending over him in
much the same way and with the same expression as of
yore. But, when he looked round, he saw that he was in
an Indian hut; and slowly the memory of what had
occurred came back to him.</p>

<p>Carenna, when she saw that he was himself again, gave
a joyous cry; then, conscious of her indiscretion, put her
finger on her lips to imply that he must remain quiet. He
felt no inclination to do otherwise, and soon fell into a
refreshing sleep, which lasted for some time.</p>

<p>When next he opened his eyes they rested on another
pair, large and steady, and that seemed to have a wondrous
depth and meaning in them. Then he saw that they
belonged to the stranger who had pulled the jaguar off,
and was now sitting alongside the mattress on which he
lay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep thee quiet, my son,&rdquo; said he in a low, musical
voice. &ldquo;All goes well, and in two or three days you
will be as strong as ever again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was something soothing in the mere glance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
eye, and in the very tones of the man&rsquo;s voice; and Leonard,
reassured by them, remained passive for a while, till
Carenna again appeared with a drink she had prepared for
him.</p>

<p>When, later, Jack Templemore came in, and Leonard
was able to talk, he found he had been ill for a week, and
that he was then in the hut of Carenna at the village of
Daranato.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had an awfully anxious time of it,&rdquo; Jack said;
&ldquo;but Monella seems skilled in doctoring, and Carenna has
been most devoted in her nursing and attention and would
brook no interference; so I&rsquo;ve had to hang around and
pass the time as best I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When once Leonard had &lsquo;turned the corner,&rsquo; as Jack
called it, he recovered rapidly, and was able, in a few
days, as Monella had predicted, to get about again. Nor
was he any the worse for his mishap; for the beast&rsquo;s teeth
had just missed scrunching the bone.</p>

<p>When he wished to offer his thanks to Monella, the
latter put him off with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We think nothing of little incidents like that, my son,
in a land such as this. Your thanks are due to God who
sent me to you at the moment; not to me. Being there, I
could not well have done otherwise than I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It appeared that Monella had come out from the village
a day or two before to look out for them, and had fallen in
with Matava. The Indian had led him towards the camp,
near which they had met Jack, who was wandering about
in search of Leonard. On learning that he was missing,
Monella had proceeded to the camp and thence&mdash;by some
method known only to himself&mdash;had tracked Leonard&rsquo;s
footsteps&mdash;a thing that even Matava confessed himself
unable to do&mdash;and thus had come upon him just in time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I saw how matters stood,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;my very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
heart seemed to stand still. Neither I nor Matava dared
to risk a shot, for the brute stood up nearly facing us and
holding you in his mouth. But that wonder, Monella,
quietly laid down his rifle and drew his knife, keeping the
beast fixed with his eye all the time; then he walked up
to it as coolly as though he were going to stroke a pet cat,
put out his hand and caught it with such a grip on the
throat that it nearly choked and had to let go of you at
once. And presto! Before it could get its breath, whizz
went the knife into its heart! And he lifted it up and
threw it away from him, clear of you, as easily as one
might a small dog. Then he picked you up and carried
you to the camp, as though you were but a baby. The
whole affair took only a few moments, and passed almost
like a dream. It&rsquo;s fortunate he happened to come out to
meet us. How could he possibly know we were coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have always told you,&rdquo; said Leonard dreamily, &ldquo;that
there seems to be a strange sympathy between my old
Indian nurse and myself. She tells me she &lsquo;felt&rsquo; that I
was in the neighbourhood, and sent word to Monella, who
at once went to her, and then came on to try to intercept
us. Only, you know, you never believed in those things.
Yet here, you see, Monella must have believed her, or he
would not have had such confidence in our coming as to
wait about for us as he did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strange,&rdquo; Jack admitted. &ldquo;I confess I do
not understand you &lsquo;dreamers.&rsquo; I am out of the running
there altogether.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that from the top of yonder
low mountain before us you can see Roraima pretty
plainly. But I had no heart to go out to look for it
while you were so ill, and, since you have been getting
better, I have preferred to stay and keep you company.
But now, I suppose, it will not be long before we set eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
at last, upon the wonderful mountain that is to be our
&lsquo;El Dorado&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill02"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&ldquo;THERE BEFORE THEM ... THEY SAW THE MYSTERIOUS RORAIMA.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Page 39.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>When Elwood heard this, he became anxious to get a
sight of the object of their journey; so, two days after,
they started before dawn, with Monella, to walk to the top
of the low mountain Jack had pointed out.</p>

<p>They reached the summit of the ridge just when the
sun was rising, and there before them, like a veritable
fairy-land in the sky, they saw the mysterious Roraima,
its pink-white and red cliffs illumined by the morning
sun, and floating in a great sea of white mist, above which
showed, here and there, the peaks of other lower mountains
like the islands they once were, but looking dark
and heavy, in their half-shadow, beside the glorious
beauty of this queen of them all, that reared herself far
above everything around.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give an adequate idea of the impressive
grandeur of this mountain, which might be likened to a
gigantic sphinx, serene and impassive in its inaccessibility.</p>

<p>Or it might be likened to a colossal fortress, built by
Titans to guard the entrance to an enchanted land beyond;
for the cliffs at its summit appeared curiously
turreted, while at the corners were great rounded masses
that might pass for towers and bastions.</p>

<p>In places, with the light-coloured cliffs were to be seen
darker rocks, black and dark green and brown, worked in,
as it were, with strange figures, as though inlaid by giant
hands. And everywhere the sides were perpendicular,
smooth, and glassy-looking. Scarce a shrub or creeper
found a precarious hold there; but down from the height,
at one spot, fell a great mass of water&mdash;like a broad band
of silver sparkling and glistening in the sunlight&mdash;that
came with one mad leap from the top and disappeared in a
cloud of spray and mist two thousand feet below. Further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
along could be seen other narrower falls like silver
threads.</p>

<p>There was no crest or peak as with most mountains.
The top was a table-land, beyond whose edge one could
see nothing. This edge was fringed with what looked like
herbage, but, seen through a powerful field-glass, proved to
be great forest trees.</p>

<p>Then, as the sun rose higher and warmed the air, the
mist cleared somewhat around the lower part of the precipitous
cliffs, so that far, far down could now be seen the
foliage that crowned the great primæval forest&mdash;the &lsquo;forest
of demons&rsquo;&mdash;that girdled the cliffs&rsquo; base. Gradually the
mist descended, and the full forest&rsquo;s height showed up like
a Titanic pedestal of green, itself floating in the haze that
still remained below.</p>

<p>By degrees the mist rolled down the mountain&rsquo;s side, for
below this extensive forest-girdle the actual base and lower
slopes began slowly to appear, with waterfalls, and cascades,
and rushing torrents and great rivers dashing and
foaming in their rocky beds. Then other intervening
ridges and patches of forest and open savanna gradually
came into view, with the full forms of the surrounding
smaller mountains, the whole making up a panorama that
was marvellous in its extent and in the variety of its
shapes and tints.</p>

<p>But scarcely had the sun revealed this wondrous sight
to their astonished eyes, when a cloud descended upon
Roraima&rsquo;s height.</p>

<p>Almost imperceptibly it grew darker, then darker still
and yet more sombre, till the erst-while fairy fortress
seemed to frown in gloomy grandeur. Its salmon-tinted
sides, but now so airy-looking in their lightness, turned
almost black, and seemed to glower upon the brilliant
landscape. The forest also lost its verdant colouring and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
looked dark and forbidding enough to pass for an enchanted
wood peopled by dragons, demons, and hobgoblins
to guard the grim castle in its centre.</p>

<p>Then the cloud descended lower still, and castle and
haunted forest passed out of sight, as swiftly and completely
as though all had been a magical illusion that had
vanished at a touch of the magician&rsquo;s wand.</p>

<p>Leonard rubbed his eyes and felt half inclined to think
he had been dreaming. All this time not a word had
been exchanged. Each had seemed wrapped up in the
weird attraction of the scene; and the new-comers, even
the practical Jack, had been astounded, almost overwhelmed,
at the sight of the stupendous cliffs and
tower-like rocks of the mysterious mountain, and its
changes from gorgeous colouring and ethereal beauty to
black opacity and shapelessness.</p>

<p>Presently Monella turned and led the way back to the
camp, the others following, each absorbed in his own
thoughts.</p>

<p>Templemore was more impressed by what he had just
witnessed than he would have cared, perhaps, to own.
Never before had he seen such a mountain, though he had
crossed the Andes, and had looked upon the loftiest and
grandest on the American Continent. To him there was
something about Roraima that was wanting in all other
mountains; a suggestiveness of the unseen, of latent
possibilities. He could now understand why the Indians
regarded it with fear and awe. It was, indeed, impossible
to look upon it without believing that some wonderful
story was hidden in its inaccessible bosom; some mysterious
secret that it kept jealously concealed from the
rest of the world. For, perhaps, the first time in his life,
he was conscious of a feeling that bordered on the superstitious.
What if that which they had witnessed were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
meant to shadow forth a warning; to be an omen! Did
it portend that, should they gain the summit of Roraima,
they would find there indeed a sort of earthly Paradise,
but that it would turn&mdash;as suddenly and completely as the
fairy-like first view had changed that morning&mdash;to the
darksome solitude of a charnel house?</p>

<p>But Leonard, for his part, when he came to talk upon
the matter, was only more enthusiastic than before; and
Monella smiled with indulgent approbation when, with
the ingenuous impulsiveness of youth, he enlarged upon
his delight and expectations.</p>

<p>When they returned to the Indian village preparations
were begun for a forward move to the place Monella had
made his head-quarters; not far from the commencement of
the mysterious forest the Indians regarded with such dread.</p>

<p>During the march thither they had many more glimpses
of Roraima; finally they emerged upon the last ridge that
faced it, from which a full view of its towering sides and
of the forest at their base could be obtained.</p>

<p>Between them was a deep ravine, along which flowed a
narrow river dotted with great boulders. Having crossed
this with some difficulty and ascended the other side, they
reached an extensive undulating plateau, an open savanna
with here and there small clumps of trees. They were
now almost under the shadow of the great cliffs, and
before them, three or four miles away, was the beginning
of the encircling wood.</p>

<p>Rounding the end of a thicket distant a mile or so from
this wood, they came suddenly upon a large and substantially
built log hut, and this, Monella told them, was his
temporary residence. Near it were several smaller huts
roughly but ingeniously formed of boughs and wood
poles, which the Indians who worked with him had constructed
for themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>As they entered the larger dwelling Monella thus
addressed them:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This, my friends, is where we shall have to live until
our work in &lsquo;Roraima Forest&rsquo; shall be completed. Make
yourselves as much at home as the circumstances will
permit; we are likely to occupy it for some time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And a fairly comfortable home it was; far more so
indeed than the young men had ventured to expect.
There was rough furniture, there were lamps for light at
night, a number of books, and many other things that
took them altogether by surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have taken you a long time,&rdquo; said Jack
Templemore, &ldquo;to get all these things transported here, and
this place built and its furniture made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has taken me years!&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>The Indians who accompanied them, numbering about
twenty, were all of Matava&rsquo;s own tribe; altogether a
different race from those who had accompanied them nearly
to Daranato and had been paid off and gone home. When
Monella had left his abode, temporarily, at Carenna&rsquo;s
request, to come to meet the two, all the Indians had gone
with him, objecting to be left so near to the &lsquo;demons&rsquo;
wood&rsquo; without him. Now, however, they quickly distributed
themselves among the huts, one acting as cook
and servant in the house, and Matava attending to all
other matters as general overlooker.</p>

<p>So far little had been said between the young men and
their strange host as to the objects and details of their
enterprise. The circumstances of their introduction had
been so unusual that the discussion had been tacitly postponed
until Leonard should have recovered sufficiently to
take part in it. And even then, when Jack had broached
the subject, Monella had remarked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better wait till you have been to my cabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
near Roraima, when I can better explain the nature of the
undertaking. Then, if you do not care to join me in it, or
we seem unlikely to get on well together, we will part
friends and you will merely have had an interesting bit of
travelling.&rdquo; So all farther explanation had been adjourned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call this more than a &lsquo;cabin,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Leonard, when
they had had time to make a sort of tour of inspection.
&ldquo;I think we ought to give it a better name. Suppose we
call it &lsquo;Monella Lodge.&rsquo;&rdquo; And &lsquo;Monella Lodge&rsquo; it was
henceforth called.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="f8">IN THE &lsquo;DEMONS&rsquo; WOOD.&rsquo;</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> following day, Monella led the two friends to the
road he had begun to cut into Roraima Forest; but
first he showed them two llamas that were kept in a rough
corral near his dwelling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought them all the way from the other side of the
continent,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know that there they are the
only beasts of burden, and in this country there are none.
They will be useful to us later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As to the so-called &lsquo;road,&rsquo; it was really but a pathway;
and, in places, almost a kind of tunnel. The great trees
of this primæval forest were so high and dense that but
little daylight penetrated to the ground beneath; and on
all sides the undergrowth was so thick and tangled that
almost every foot had to be cut out with the axe. Here
and there one could see for a few yards between the giant
trunks, and at these spots the path had been made wider.
One curious thing Jack noted: the path did not start from
that part of the wood opposite to &lsquo;Monella Lodge&rsquo;; nor
even from the margin of the wood itself.</p>

<p>Asked why this was, Monella thus made answer:
&ldquo;If in our absence others should come here, they might
hunt up and down for the path a long time before they hit
upon it&mdash;and very likely never find it. On this stony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
ground the tracks we leave are very slight and difficult to
trace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;your Indians know the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not one of them would ever show another man the
way,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;let him offer what he might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why all these precautions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Later you will understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, when Jack came to look round, his heart sank
within him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should not care to have a few miles of railway to cut
through wood like this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the worst I ever
saw. I do not wonder you have found it more than you
could manage&mdash;only yourself and these Indians&mdash;and it&rsquo;s a
wonder you ever got them to join at all, considering all the
circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s where it is,&rdquo; Monella answered. &ldquo;Many
men would have despaired, I think. We have had trouble,
too. Two Indians met with accidents and were badly
hurt; though now they are recovering. Then, some of
the small streams that issue from the mountain became
suddenly swollen once or twice, and washed away the
rough bridges we had made across them; and we have
met with many unexpected obstacles, such as great masses
of rock, or a fallen tree, some giant of the forest that was
so big it was easier to go round it than to cut through it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That evening, Monella explained his project, and showed
the young men the plans and diagrams Dr. Lorien had
spoken of, and then went on to say,</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you decide to join me, you ought to know something
of the language in which these old documents are written.
I both read and write it, and I speak it too. You will
find it interesting to decipher them, and an occupation for
the evenings.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack was not enthusiastic at this suggestion; but
Leonard cordially embraced it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To learn the language of an unknown nation that has
passed away will be curious and <em>very</em> interesting,&rdquo; he
declared, &ldquo;and will, as you say, help to pass the time.
You may as well learn it too, Jack. You speak the Indian&mdash;why
not learn this? Then we can talk together in a
tongue that no one but ourselves and our friend here can
understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where did these ancient people &lsquo;hang out&rsquo;?&rdquo;
asked Jack irreverently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard of the lake of Titicaca and the ancient
ruins of the great city of Tiahuanaco; a city on this
continent believed by archæologists to be at least as old as
Thebes and the Pyramids?&rdquo; Monella asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> have,&rdquo; Leonard answered, &ldquo;though I know very
little about them. But I believe I was in that country
when very young, and had a curious escape from death
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella turned his gaze quickly upon the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it. What do you remember?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do not remember anything; I was too young.
But I have been <em>told</em> how that my father went somewhere
in that district on a prospecting expedition, and, not liking
to be separated from my mother, took her with him, and
my nurse, Carenna, and myself. Whilst there they came
across a small settlement of white people, as I understand,
and remained with them some time. There was amongst
these people a child of my own age, and so exactly like
me, that my nurse grew almost as fond of it as she was
of me, and used to like to take the two out together.
One day, it seems, we both went to sleep on the grass,
and she left us for a few minutes to gather fruit. When
she returned a poisonous snake crawled hissing away, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
she found the other poor little child had been bitten and
was dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I know about it. Who the people were,
and where the place was, I cannot say. I have always
understood, however, that it was somewhere in the direction
of Lake Titicaca. But Carenna could tell you more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what about this ancient people of yours?&rdquo;
Templemore asked of Monella, who still gazed thoughtfully
and inquiringly at Leonard. Templemore had heard
of Elwood&rsquo;s early adventure many times before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;High up on the eastern slopes of the great Andes is
an extensive plain, as large as the whole of British
Guiana,&rdquo; the old man replied. &ldquo;It is twelve thousand
feet above the level of the sea, and there, at that great
height, is also the largest lake of South America, Lake
Titicaca, over three thousand square miles in extent,
on the shores of which was once a mighty city called
Tiahuanaco. It is now in ruins; yet, even amongst its
ruins, it boasts of some of the oldest and most wonderful
monuments in the world. Two thousand feet above this
again, are another large plain and another lake, little
known to the outside world, being, indeed, almost inaccessible.
It was there my people dwelt, and tradition
asserts that they retired thither when driven out of
Tiahuanaco by some invasion of hordes from other parts
of the continent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it a very old language, do you suppose?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly one of the oldest in the world; and yet
not difficult to acquire by those who know the language of
Matava and his tribe&mdash;as you do. It has some affinity to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As regards the tongue spoken by the Indians, Leonard
had learnt it from Carenna in his childhood; and Templemore
had picked up a good deal from the same source, as
well as on his hunting expeditions with Leonard and Matava.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>When it came to discussing terms, Monella declared
that he had none to make, except that on no consideration
whatever should any other white man be invited or
allowed to join them. As to the rest, he simply suggested
that any wealth they might acquire by their enterprise
should be shared equally between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose one of us were to die,&rdquo; observed Jack.
&ldquo;How then? Might not the survivors choose some one
else to join them? Though,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully,
&ldquo;if it were <em>you</em>, we should not be likely to go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> shall not die, my friend, until my task be finished,&rdquo;
replied Monella with conviction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot say,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s rejoinder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not say I <em>know</em>, yet I can say I <em>feel</em> it. No
man dieth till he hath fulfilled the work in life allotted to
him by God,&rdquo; Monella finished solemnly.</p>

<p>The others already knew him, by this time, as a man
with deep-seated religious convictions; though he made
no parade of his beliefs. He seemed to have a simple,
steady faith in an overruling Providence, and showed it,
unostentatiously, in many ways, both in his actions, and
in the advice he gave, on occasion, to the young men.</p>

<p>In the result, the bargain&mdash;if it can be so termed&mdash;was
concluded. Elwood and Templemore formally enrolled
themselves under Monella&rsquo;s leadership, and henceforth
performed the duties he assigned to them; amongst
other things assisting almost daily in the formation of
the path that was to take them through the forest. When
not so engaged, they would go out with some of the
Indians on hunting or fishing excursions in search of food.</p>

<p>Monella had with him, amongst other things, a
beautifully finished theodolite of wonderful accuracy and
delicacy; with this he settled the direction of the road
from day to day. Often, obstacles were encountered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
made it impossible to go straight; these had to be worked
round and the proper direction picked up again by means
of Monella&rsquo;s calculations.</p>

<p>Another circumstance worthy of note and that caused
the two young men at first some surprise, was the fact
that Monella had with him some mirrors specially prepared
and fixed in strong cases for carrying about in
rough travel, and intended for heliographic signalling.
They frequently took these out and practised with them
by sending messages to one another from the ridges of
hills far apart. Monella tried also to instruct Matava
and some of the Indians in the work, but without success.
They were indeed afraid of the glasses, and looked upon
it all as some kind of magic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be simpler to go up the bed of this
stream that you seem to have been following more or less
all the time, even if it be longer?&rdquo; observed Jack one day.</p>

<p>Monella shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use, my friend. It divides into so many branches;
and then again, in case of a rise of its waters, we should
have all our road submerged at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Sundays they always rested. This, it appeared,
had been Monella&rsquo;s custom all along.</p>

<p>In his conversations in the evenings and during their
Sunday strolls, he would instruct and amuse his hearers
with his reminiscences and adventures in all parts of the
world, or with his intimate knowledge of the wild life
around them. From his account, he had undergone, at
times, terrible and extraordinary hardships and privations
on the plains and in the forests of India and Africa; of
Australia; the Steppes of Tartary; the Highlands of
Thibet; the interior of China and Japan; the wilds of
Siberia; of Canada; the prairies of North America, and the
pampas, plains, and rugged mountains of South America&mdash;all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
as Dr. Lorien had said, seemed to be alike known to
him. Nor was he less familiar with the countries and
cities of Europe; yet he spoke of his travels and experiences
in a simple manner that had in it nothing of
boastfulness or ostentation, but as though his sole object
were to amuse and entertain his two young friends.</p>

<p>As they penetrated farther into the forest, their work
became harder and the progress slower. This latter was
unavoidable, since each day they had to walk farther and
farther to and fro. Moreover, the Indians, who had displayed
greater courage&mdash;so Monella had said&mdash;now that
they had two more white men with them, once more
began to show signs of nervous apprehension and fear.</p>

<p>This was doubtless due to the great difference in many
ways&mdash;some definite enough, others indefinable and vague&mdash;between
this forest and those generally to be found
in the tropical regions of South America. Not only were
the trees still more gigantic&mdash;making it gloomier&mdash;and
the undergrowths more dense and tangled, but the birds
and animals, judging from their cries, were unfamiliar to
them. Many of the sounds usual to forest life in
British Guiana were absent; the constant note of the
&lsquo;bell-bird&rsquo; was not heard, nor was even the startling
roar of the howling monkeys. Instead were heard other
sounds and noises of an entirely novel and peculiar
kind, unknown even to the Indians who had been used
to forest travelling all their lives; sounds that even
Monella either could not explain&mdash;or hesitated to. One
of these was a horrid combination of hiss and snort and
whistle, loud and prolonged like the stertorous breathings
of some monstrous creature. Some of the Indians
declared that this was the sound traditionally said
to proceed from the great &lsquo;camoodi,&rsquo; the monstrous
serpent that is supposed to guard the way to Roraima<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
mountain; while others inclined to the opinion that it
was made by the equally dreaded &lsquo;didi,&rsquo; the gigantic
&lsquo;wild man of the woods,&rsquo; that also had, as they averred, its
special haunts in this particular forest. At times, a
startling, long-drawn cry would echo through the wood, so
human in its tones as sometimes to cause them to rush in
the direction it seemed to come from, in the belief that it
was a cry for help from one of the party who was in
danger. This strange, harrowing cry, the Indians called
&lsquo;The cry of a Lost Soul&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>; and they were always seized
with panic when it was heard.</p>

<p>There were other cries and sounds equally mysterious
and perplexing; and, so the Indians began to declare,
strange sights too. Of these they could give no clear
account, but they maintained that, in the shadows in the
darker places, or just before nightfall, while returning from
their work, they now and then caught passing glimpses
of vague shapes that seemed to peer at them and then disappear
within the gloomy forest depths. And even Elwood
and Templemore were conscious of the occasional presence
of these silent unfamiliar shapes, and sometimes fired at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
them, though without result. These facts they made no
attempt to conceal from one another, though, in their
intercourse with the Indians, they put a bold face on
matters, and affected to disbelieve the stories told them.</p>

<p>Monella alone was&mdash;or appeared to be&mdash;entirely undisturbed
by all these things. If conscious of them, he
gave no sign of it, but went about whatever he had to
do as though danger were to him an unknown quantity.</p>

<p>There was, however, one unpleasant fact that could not
be ignored, and that was the unusual number of &lsquo;bush-masters&rsquo;
of large size in the wood. This is a poisonous
snake, very gaudily coloured, whose bite is certain death.
It does not&mdash;like most serpents&mdash;try to get out of the
way of human beings, but, instead, rushes to attack them
with great swiftness and ferocity. It is the only <em>aggressive</em>
venomous snake of the American continent. It usually
attains a length of five or six feet; but, in this forest, the
explorers killed many of eight or nine feet, and two&mdash;that
came on to the attack together&mdash;were nearly eleven feet
long, with fangs as large as a parrot&rsquo;s claw. In consequence
of the frequency of the attacks of these reptiles,
so much dreaded by the Indians, and indeed by all
travellers, one or two of a working party, armed with shot
guns, had to be told off to keep watch; rifles being of
no use for the purpose.</p>

<p>Templemore, as it happened, had had a bad fright when
a child from an adventure with a snake; and this&mdash;as is
frequently the case&mdash;had left in his mind, all the rest of
his life, a great horror of serpents. He found, therefore,
the presence of these &lsquo;lords of the woods,&rsquo; as their Indian
name implies, a source of ever-present abhorrence.</p>

<p>Besides the &lsquo;bush-masters,&rsquo; there were the &lsquo;labarri&rsquo;&mdash;also
a large venomous snake, but not aggressive like the
other&mdash;and rattlesnakes. There were also, no doubt, boa-constrictors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
or &lsquo;camoodis,&rsquo; of the ordinary kind; but,
thus far, only one had been seen, and that, though large,
was nothing out of the way as regards size for that
country.</p>

<p>Nor were serpents their only visible enemies; there
were others of a kind new to the two young men. One
day, while with the working party at the farthest part of
the track, they heard the whole forest suddenly resound
with a perfect babel of discordant noises. There were
shrill cries and squeals, hoarse roars and growls, then
a kind of trumpeting. The Indians retreated, throwing
down their axes to pick up their rifles. As they hastily
retired, four large animals sprang into their path, one
after the other, with loud roars and growls. But Monella,
who was behind Elwood, stepped forward and rolled two
over with his repeating rifle, and Jack stopped another of
the beasts with his. The fourth, apparently not liking
the way things were going, leaped into the thicket and
disappeared; though, judging from the sounds that came
from the direction it had taken, there were many more of
its fellows close at hand. Gradually their cries grew
fainter, until they died away in the distance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, further shots had given the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grâce</i>
to the three that had been knocked over, and the victors
went up to examine them. They seemed to be a kind
of panther or leopard of a light grey colour, approaching
white in places, with markings of a deeper
colour.</p>

<p>Neither Templemore nor Elwood had ever previously
seen any animal, or the skin of one, at all like these.
They were, moreover, of different shape from either the
jaguar or the tiger-cat; larger than the latter, and more
thick-set than the former.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These must be the &lsquo;white jaguars&rsquo; that the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
say help to guard Roraima,&rdquo; Jack observed, looking in
perplexity at the strange creatures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Matava, who had now come up, &ldquo;and
they are &lsquo;Warracaba tigers.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth are they?&rdquo; asked Leonard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Warracaba tiger,&rdquo; Monella said, &ldquo;is the name given
to a species of small &lsquo;tiger&rsquo; (in America all such animals
are called &lsquo;tigers&rsquo;) that hunts in packs, and is reputed to
be unusually ferocious. They have a peculiar trumpeting
cry, not unlike the sound made by the Warracaba bird&mdash;the
&lsquo;trumpet-bird&rsquo;&mdash;hence their name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They look to me more like light-coloured pumas,&rdquo; Jack
remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; pumas are not marked like that, and do not make
the sounds we heard. Besides, you need never fear a
puma, and should never shoot at one, unless it is attacking
your domestic animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both Templemore and Elwood looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always thought,&rdquo; the latter said, &ldquo;that pumas were
such bloodthirsty animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they are, to other animals&mdash;even the jaguar they
attack and kill. But men they never touch, if let alone.
I do not believe there is a single authenticated instance of
a puma&rsquo;s hurting any human being, man, woman or child.
In the Andes and Brazil&mdash;where I have lived long enough
to know&mdash;the Gauchos call the puma &lsquo;Amigo del cristiano&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
friend of man&rsquo;&mdash;and they think it an evil thing to
kill one.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>A few days after, they were attacked again by these
furious creatures, and this time did not come off so well,
for two of the Indians were badly mauled. But for
Monella&rsquo;s cool bravery, indeed, matters would have been
much worse; and Templemore had a narrow escape.
Then, a day or two later, one of the Indians was stung by
a scorpion; and Jack came near being bitten by a rattlesnake&mdash;would
have been but for Monella, who, just in
time, boldly seized the reptile by the tail, and, swinging it
two or three times round his head, dashed its brains out
against a piece of rock.</p>

<p>Indeed, upon all occasions where there was any kind of
danger, Monella&rsquo;s ready, quiet courage was always displayed
in a manner that won both the admiration of his
white colleagues and the devotion of his Indian followers.
Moreover, as Dr. Lorien had stated, and as Leonard had
found by actual experience, he was skilled in medicine and
surgery. To wounds he applied the leaves of some plant,
of which he had a store with him in a dried state, the
curative effects of which were reputed among the Indians
to be almost marvellous.</p>

<p>But even these incidents were surpassed by a startling
experience they had a short time afterwards. On going
to their working ground one morning, two or three Indians
in advance of the remainder of the party saw, lying across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the path, what they took to be the trunk of a tree that
had fallen during the night; and they sat upon it, indolently,
to wait for the others to come up. Suddenly,
one of them sprang up, exclaiming, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alive! I felt it
move! It is breathing!&rdquo; They all jumped up, in alarm,
when the great snake&mdash;for such it proved to be&mdash;glided
off into the wood. Most likely the others would have
ridiculed their story, but that Templemore happened to
come up in time to witness what occurred. And through
the underwood, on both sides of the path, was plainly to
be seen a sort of small tunnel that marked the place
where the serpent had been lying asleep.</p>

<p>Matava and his fellows, of course, insisted that this
was the great &lsquo;camoodi,&rsquo; that Indian tradition had long
declared existed in this forest&mdash;set there specially, by the
demons of the mountain, to guard it from intrusion.</p>

<p>These constant dangers and adventures made the task
of keeping the Indians from deserting doubly difficult, and
rendered the work both harassing and tedious to the
others. Only Monella showed no weariness, no sign of
the strain it all involved; so far from that, these troubles
seemed only to increase his vigilance, his power of endurance,
and his determination.</p>

<p>And all the time they were cutting their way through
vegetation that would have astonished and delighted the
heart of a botanical collector such as Dr. Lorien. Not
only within the wood, but in the whole district round,
unknown and wondrous flowers and plants abounded.
But the explorers had neither time nor inclination to take
that interest in them they merited, and would, at any
other time, have undoubtedly excited.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<span class="i0">So full of hopeless agony and fear,<br /></span>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="f8">THE MYSTERIOUS CAVERN.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> the time drew near for the adventurers, if
Monella&rsquo;s calculations proved correct, to reach the
base of the towering rock towards which they were
making their way with so much labour, a suppressed
excitement became apparent throughout nearly the whole
party. It was clearly visible in the Indians and in
Elwood; and Templemore, even, showed signs of anxiety.
Monella alone was imperturbable as ever, and, if any
unusual feeling arose in his mind, there was no trace of
it to be seen in his placid manner. Perhaps a close
observer might have seen, at times, a little more fire in
the gaze of his keen eyes; but it was scarcely noticeable
to those around him.</p>

<p>Elwood did not attempt to hide the state of expectancy
into which he had gradually worked himself; but while
he, on the one hand, grew more excited, Jack Templemore,
on the other, became steadily more pessimistic and moody.
Since the adventure of the great &lsquo;camoodi&rsquo; he seemed
nervous and depressed, and he no longer troubled himself
to conceal the discontent that now possessed him. The
continued sojourn in that terrible forest was becoming too
much for his peculiar temperament. Its gloom oppressed
him more and more each day; and he had become silent
and unsociable, often sitting for long intervals stolidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
smoking and, if addressed, replying only in monosyllables.
They had now been for some weeks in the wood, camping
in it every night, and going back to &lsquo;Monella Lodge&rsquo;
only for the Sundays. To this rule Monella rigidly adhered;
but, since it took the greater part of a day to reach
the edge of the forest from the point they had now
attained, but little work was done at the path-making on
Saturdays, Sundays, or Mondays. Hence their progress
had become slower, and Templemore&rsquo;s discontent and
impatience increased in proportion.</p>

<p>One morning, after breakfast, Jack was sitting on a log
moodily smoking, while Elwood was busying himself
clearing up after the meal recently finished. Monella and
all the Indians had gone to the path-end, and were out of
sight; but the strokes of their axes, and their calls one to
another, could be heard distinctly, now and again, echoing
through the almost silent wood. Very little else broke
the stillness, but once or twice they had heard that weird
sound, half hiss, half whistle, that the Indians attributed
to the monstrous serpent. Presently, Jack took his pipe
from his mouth and addressed Elwood:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You heard what Monella said last night, that he
hoped to-day or to-morrow would see the end of this
work. Supposing, as I expect, that we find that we
merely run against inaccessible cliff, I want to know what
you intend to do. To attempt to work either to right or
to left, along the foot of the rock, in the hope of finding
an opening would be, I feel convinced, a mere wild-goose
chase, and would lead us only farther into this hateful
forest, and uselessly prolong our stay in it. Now, Leonard,
is it agreed that the thing is to end when we get to the
cliff? I&rsquo;ve asked you again and again as to this, but you
always put me off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I put it off&mdash;till the time comes for deciding about it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
that&rsquo;s all, you old grumbler. What is the use of talking
before we see how Monella&rsquo;s calculations come out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I grumble, as you call it, it is because I am anxious
for others. I gave a solemn promise before I left my
poor old mother that I would not rush into any obvious
and unnecessary danger; any danger, that is, beyond
the ordinary risks of travel in a country like Guiana.
Now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what dangers have we courted that are beyond
the &lsquo;ordinary risks of travel,&rsquo; as you call them?&rdquo; Elwood
demanded cheerfully. &ldquo;We have come safely through
forests and plains thus far, and now we are in another
forest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what a forest! I have been, as you know,
pioneering in the furthermost recesses of Brazil and Peru;
I know a little&mdash;just a <em>little</em>&mdash;you will allow, of wild life;
but never have I seen the like of this wood! No wonder
the Indians shun and fear it; indeed, it is a marvel to me
how Monella ever induced them to enter upon this work,
and it is still more wonderful how he has managed to keep
them from deserting him. Heaven knows what we have
experienced of the place is enough to try the courage of
the best&mdash;the most ferocious &lsquo;tigers,&rsquo; the biggest serpents
of one sort ever dreamed of, and the more deadly and more
fiercely aggressive venomous ones; strange creatures that
one can only catch glimpses of and can never see; sounds
so weird and unnatural that even the Indians can offer no
explanation. That great serpent, alone, fills me with a
continual cold horror. We never know where it may be
lurking; it may make a rush at one of us at any moment,
and what chance would one have with such a beast?
What consolation, to think it would probably get a bullet
through its head from one of us, if, while that was being
done, it crushed another to a jelly?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your old horror and dislike of serpents make you
nervous, old boy. I wish you could get over it. In all
else, you know, you are as bold as&mdash;as&mdash;well, as Monella
himself; and that is saying a lot, isn&rsquo;t it? You must
admit that, if our enterprise has its dangers, we have a
leader who knows what he is doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A splendid fellow! but&mdash;a dreamer&mdash;or&mdash;a madman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A madman! He has method in his madness then!
I admire him more and more every day. He is a man
to lead an army; to inspire the weakest; to put courage
into the most timid. I do not wonder the Indians are so
devoted to him. <em>I</em> would follow him anywhere, do anything
he told me! His very glance seems to thrill you
through with a courage that makes you ready to dare
everything! He is a born leader of men! He carries out,
in every action, in his manner, his air, his principles, his
extraordinary cool courage, and his gentle, simple courtesy,
all my ideas of a hero of romance of the olden time&mdash;the
very <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau idéal</i> of a great king and chivalrous knight. <em>I</em>
can see all this; his very looks, his slightest motions are
full of a strange dignity; never have I seen one who so
excited alike my admiration and my affection! Yet, I do
admit he is a mystery. One knows nothing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Jack burst in, interrupting at last the speech
of the enthusiastic Leonard. &ldquo;It is true, what you say,
in a measure. He seems to have in him the making of
such a man as you, I can see, have in your mind&mdash;a hero,
a leader of men. Yet here is he, an unknown wanderer
on the face of the earth, giving up the last years of his life
to a fatuous chase after El Dorado, with a few Indians and
a couple of credulous young idiots joining in his mad
quest. I like him; I admire him; I believe in his
sincerity. But I say he is mad all the same, a dreamer;
and for the matter of that, so are you. You suit each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
other, you two. Two dreamers together!&rdquo; And Templemore
got up and began pacing up and down, restless in
body and disturbed in mind.</p>

<p>Leonard watched him with a half smile; but Templemore
looked serious and anxious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are surrounded by hidden enemies&mdash;many of
them deadly creatures,&rdquo; he went on gloomily. &ldquo;Already
three of us have fallen victims, and we know not who
may be the next. Even the most constant and watchful
vigilance does not avail in a place like this; and the
never-ceasing worry of it is becoming more than I can
stand. One wants eyes like a hawk&rsquo;s and ears like an
Indian&rsquo;s. One cannot feel safe for a single minute; you
want eyes at the back of your head&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard went up and put his hand on the other&rsquo;s
arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All because you are so anxious about <em>me</em> and others,
dear old boy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you really thought of yourself
alone you would never trouble; but you make a great
affectation of nervous apprehension for yourself, while all
the time you are thinking only of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Templemore shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it is,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;but the thought
of that great snake <em>haunts</em> me. I feel as if some terrible
trouble were in store for us through it. A kind of presentiment;
a feeling I have never had before&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elwood burst out laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A presentiment! Great Scott! <em>You</em> confessing to a
presentiment! You who always deride <em>my</em> presentiments,
and dreams, and omens! Well, this is too good, upon
my word! Who is the dreamer <em>now</em>, I should like to
know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then they heard a call, and, looking along the path,
saw Monella at some distance beckoning to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring a lantern,&rdquo; they heard him say, &ldquo;and come
with me, both of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lantern!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack. He took one up and
examined it to see that there was plenty of oil. &ldquo;What
on earth can he want with a lantern? Is he going to look
for the sun in this land of shadow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they came up to Monella they looked at him inquiringly,
but no sign was to be had from a study of his
impassive face. Yet there seemed, Jack thought, a softer
gleam in his eyes when he met his gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think our work is at an end,&rdquo; he said to the young
men; &ldquo;and,&rdquo; addressing Jack more particularly, &ldquo;your
anxiety may now, let us hope, be lightened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he turned and walked on with a gesture for the
two to follow. And Templemore felt confused; for the words
Monella had spoken came like an answer to the thoughts
that had been in his mind; so much so that he could not
help asking himself, had this strange being divined what
he and Elwood had been talking, and he (Jack) had been
so seriously thinking, of?</p>

<p>However, these speculations were soon driven away by
surprise at the change in the character of the wood. The
trees grew less thickly, and the ground became more stony,
the undergrowth gradually thinner; more daylight filtered
down from above, and soon they found they could see
between the trunks of the trees for some distance ahead.
And then, in the front of them, it grew lighter and lighter,
and shortly the welcome sound of falling water struck upon
their ears. Then they came upon a stream&mdash;presumably
the same that they had been, in a measure, following
through the wood&mdash;rushing and tumbling in a rocky bed&mdash;for
they were going up rising ground&mdash;and splashing and
foaming in its leaps from rock to rock. The trees became
still sparser, and the light stronger, till, finally, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
emerged into an open space and saw, rising straight up
before them, the perpendicular flat rock that formed the
base of Roraima&rsquo;s lofty summit.</p>

<p>It was here fairly light; indeed, a single ray of sunlight
played upon the splashing water in the little stream, and
the spray sparkled in the gleam. But still very little sunlight
ever entered the place. The great wall of rock that
reared itself in a plumb-line two thousand feet into the
sky, overshadowed it completely on the one side; and on
the other were the great trees of this primæval forest
towering up three hundred feet or more, and extending
their branches above across almost to the rock, though
below, the nearest trunk was quite fifty yards away. They
stood, in fact, upon the edge of a semi-circular clearing
that extended for a distance of perhaps a hundred yards,
its radius being about fifty yards if taken from the centre
of the exposed portion of the cliff. At each end of this
space the trees and undergrowth closed in again upon
the rock in an impenetrable tangled mass, denser, and
darker even, than that through which the explorers had
been slowly cutting their way.</p>

<p>Some of the Indians were grouped round the stream,
two or three enjoying the luxury of wading in it, or sitting
on the bank and dangling their feet in the clear cool water.
Matava and the others were busy upon some kind of rough
carpentering. Templemore and Elwood saw that the
stream issued from a hole in the rock near one end of the
clearing; and this was of itself a matter for surprise.
They were, however, still more astonished when Monella,
with a strange smile, pointed out another aperture in the
rock near the centre of the open portion of the cliff. It was
about sixteen or eighteen feet from the ground, and was
not unlike a window or embrasure in a stone building of considerable
thickness. Within&mdash;at a distance of eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
inches or so&mdash;it seemed however to be closed by solid
rock.</p>

<p>The two gazed in silence at this unexpected sight;
Elwood showing in his eager manner the hopes that it
aroused, and Templemore pondering in silent wonder as
to what it all meant. That Monella&rsquo;s &lsquo;calculations&rsquo; had
led them to a most unexpected result thus far&mdash;whether
by accident or otherwise&mdash;he could not but admit. Of
the fact there was now no doubt. But a clearing of this
character, opposite to what looked like an opening in the
rock, or entrance to a cave, was a fact too startling to be
the outcome of a mere coincidence, or a lucky chance. He
knew that a party of explorers might spend years&mdash;centuries,
indeed, if they could live long enough&mdash;in a search
for such a place in that forest and never find it, unless
guided by the most exact information. Then the fact that
the opening was so nearly in the centre of the clearing
had a significance of its own; the question whether it was
actually the entrance to a cave or merely a curious accidental
hollow in the rock was thus answered, as it were,
in advance. Besides, just below the &lsquo;embrasure&rsquo; a small
stream trickled out, and, falling down the rock, found its
way amongst the stones to the larger water-course beyond.
Here there seemed presumptive evidence that the space at
the back of the rock was hollow&mdash;was, in fact, a cave.
But in that case the entrance must have been purposely
closed by human hands. If so, by whom? and when?
and why?</p>

<p>These thoughts revolved rapidly in Templemore&rsquo;s mind
while he stood looking at the rock. He glanced around at
the giant trees, and thought of the almost impenetrable
character of the forest they had come through, and he felt
that, if the ideas that had come into his mind were correct,
it was impossible to suppose that such a cave could be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
retreat say, of any unknown Indians living at the present
time. Therefore, the puzzle seemed the greater. <em>Who</em>
could have been there before them&mdash;and how long
ago?</p>

<p>But Matava now approached the cliff bearing a sort of
rough ladder that he had constructed under Monella&rsquo;s
directions; this he placed against the rock just under the
opening, planting the ends firmly in the ground. He had
cut down two young saplings and, partly by means of
notches, and partly by twisting some strong fibres to hold
them, had fastened cross-pieces at short intervals, and so
fashioned the whole into a very serviceable ladder.</p>

<p>Monella signed to him to hold it firmly, and proceeded
to test its strength. Then, satisfied as to this, he quietly
mounted it till he could insert his hand into the aperture.
After a moment or two he called to Elwood and Templemore
to assist in steadying the ladder; and, when they
had come to the assistance of Matava and another Indian
who was with him, Monella leaned over into the opening
and, exerting all his great strength, pushed away the stone
that was closing it, exposing to view a cavern beyond.
After a brief look inside, he asked for a lighted lantern and
a long stick, and, while these were being handed up, the
expectations and curiosity of his companions became excited
to a lively degree. The Indians, who had been amusing
themselves in the water, came crowding round, half pleased,
half afraid at this unexpected development of events.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re never going to venture into that place?&rdquo;
Templemore asked. &ldquo;It may be full of deadly serpents.
For Heaven&rsquo;s sake do not be rash enough to risk it. Send
one of the Indians&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella replied with a look&mdash;a look that Jack remembered
for many a day after. His eyes simply flashed; and
then he said quickly,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever know me bid another go where I would
not venture myself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he took the lighted lantern, swung it into the
cavern at the end of the stick, and, having satisfied himself
that the air within was not foul, he threw the stick in
first and followed, himself, into the semi-darkness.</p>

<p>A minute after, his head and shoulders re-appeared, just
when Jack was half way up the ladder to follow him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a few minutes before you come up,&rdquo; he asked
him. &ldquo;I just want to give a glance round, and there is
but one lantern. Or&mdash;well&mdash;suppose you come up and
wait inside. But tell the others to keep to the bottom of
the ladder, and be ready to hold it in case we should wish
to beat a hasty retreat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This seemed prudent counsel, and was carried out.
When Jack got off the ladder into the opening, he was
told to jump down inside; and he found there a level
rocky floor about three feet below the aperture, which
had thus a resemblance to a veritable window. By the
dim light it gave he could see that he was in a cavern of
considerable height and extent, and Monella, with his
lantern, disappearing through an arched opening at some
distance that seemed to lead to another cave within. He
had brought with him his double-barrel, one barrel loaded
with small shot, the other with ball, and he gave a look
at the revolver in his belt while he stood waiting at the
entrance and gazing curiously about him. He saw that
a small stream of water ran through one side of the
cave; there were, in fact, two streams, for one ran in
a ledge at some distance from the ground; but when
it came to the opening they had come through, it fell
to the floor and joined the other stream, the whole
finding its way out through a fissure in the rock and
running down outside, as has been before described.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Now the stone slab that had closed the &lsquo;window,&rsquo; as
Jack called the opening, had rested on a continuation of
what may be termed the sill, and, on being pushed, had
rolled off. It was a thin slab, roughly circular in shape;
not unlike what one might suppose a millstone to be in
the rough. Jack regarded it with close attention, almost
indeed with awe; it spoke so plainly of human beings
having inhabited the place, or, at least, of their having
fashioned this method of closing the entrance to the cave.
How long ago had they been there? And, when they
went away, why had they closed the entrance so carefully?</p>

<p>Monella seemed a long time away; so long that Jack
at last began to think of starting to look for him&mdash;they
had already sent for another lantern in case it should be
required&mdash;when he heard his footsteps in the distance,
and shortly afterwards saw the gleam from his lantern.
When he came closer, Jack scanned his face keenly, but,
as usual, read nothing there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can call Elwood,&rdquo; said Monella, &ldquo;and I will take
you to where I have been. You need have no fear; the
place is quite free from reptiles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When, however, Leonard was called, a difficulty arose;
Matava and his fellows objected very strongly to being
left alone outside; but it also appeared that they objected
still more strongly to coming into the cavern. On no
consideration whatever would they enter &lsquo;the demons&rsquo;
den,&rsquo; as they had already named it. But, since they had
to make a choice, they elected, in the end, to remain
outside and wait.</p>

<p>When Elwood was inside and had had a few moments
in which to get accustomed to the obscurity and peer
wonderingly about him, Monella pointed out how the
opening had been closed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to notice,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;that this stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
was <em>cemented</em>, and this little stream of water that has
accidentally found its way round here, has, in the course
of time, loosened the cement; else I could not have pushed
the stone away. We should have had to blast it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;and it also shows that it was closed
<em>from the inside</em>. Whoever last closed it never went out
again&mdash;at least not by this entrance. Where then did
they go to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we have to see about,&rdquo; returned Monella.
&ldquo;Now, follow me, and I will show you something that will
surprise you.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="f8">THE CANYON WITHIN THE MOUNTAIN.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Monella</span>, with the lantern in his hand, led his
two companions through an arched opening into
a second cavern which seemed to be larger and loftier
than the first; and this, in turn, opened into a third, at
one end of which they could see that daylight entered.
Monella stopped here and, lifting the light high in one
hand, pointed with the other to side-openings in the rock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are side-galleries, so to speak,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
do not appear to be of any great extent. I have been to
the end of two or three. They all seem to be perfectly
empty too; not so much as a trace of anything did I see,
save loose pieces of stone here and there, that had, no
doubt, fallen from the roof. Now we will go to the
entrance on this side.&rdquo; And he turned and walked on
towards the place where they could see the glimmering of
daylight.</p>

<p>Quite suddenly they turned a corner and saw before
them a high archway, leading out into the open air; and,
before the two young men had had time to express surprise,
they had stepped out of the gloomy cavern into a valley,
where they stood and stared in helpless astonishment upon
a scene that was as lovely and enchanting as it was utterly
unexpected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>They saw before them the bottom of a valley, or
canyon, of about half a mile in length, and nearly a quarter
of a mile in width; its floor, if one may use the expression,
consisted chiefly of fine sand of a warm tawny hue;
its sides, of rocks of white or pinkish white fine-grained
sandstone, with here and there veins, two or three feet
wide, of some metallic-looking material that glistened in
the sunlight like masses of gold and silver. In other
places were veins of jasper, porphyry, or some analogous
rock, that sparkled and flashed as though embedded with
diamonds; other parts again were dark-coloured, like
black marble, throwing up in strong relief the ferns and
flowers that grew in front of them.</p>

<p>At the further end of the valley a waterfall tumbled
and foamed in the rays of the sun which, being now
almost overhead, threw its beams along the whole length
of the canyon. The stream that flowed below the fall
widened out into clear pools here and there, fringed by
stretches of velvety sward of a vivid green. The water
of this stream was of a wonderful turquoise-blue tint,
different from anything, Templemore thought, that he had
ever seen before; and he and Elwood gazed with admiration
at its inviting pellucid pools. But most extraordinary of
all were the flowers that nearly everywhere were to be
seen. In shape, in brilliancy of colouring, and in many
other respects, they differed entirely from even the rare
and wonderful orchids and other blossoms they had come
across in the vicinity of Roraima. Of trees there were
not many, though a few were dotted about here and there
by the side of the river; and, in places, graceful palms
grew out of the rocky slopes at the sides and leaned over,
somewhat after the fashion of gigantic ferns. Though the
valley was so shut in, and the heat in the sun very great,
yet the amount of green vegetation on all sides, the blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
water, and the light-coloured, cool-looking rocks, made up
a scene that was gratefully refreshing after the gloom of
the forest scenes to which the explorers had been so long
accustomed. Moreover, by stepping back into the cool
air of the cavern, they could look out upon it all without
experiencing the drawback of the intense heat.</p>

<p>Elwood was in ecstasies. The triumphant light in his
eyes, when he turned round and looked at his friend, was
a thing to see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You confounded, wretched old grumbler,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;what have you to say now? Is not <em>this</em> worth coming
for? Or is it that even <em>this</em> will not suit you? Perhaps
it is all too bright, the water too blue, the flowers too
highly coloured, or&rdquo;&mdash;here a most delicious scent was
wafted across from some of the flowers&mdash;&ldquo;they are perfumed
too highly to please you! You haven&rsquo;t found
fault with anything yet, and we have been here nearly
five minutes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack laughed; and Leonard noticed that it was more
like his old, easy, good-natured laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are too severe upon me, Leonard,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think so, Monella?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella, the while, had been standing gazing on the
scene like one in a dream. More than once he passed
his hand across his eyes in a confused way, as though to
make sure he was awake. When thus addressed, however,
he seemed to rouse himself, and, without noticing the
bantering question that had been addressed to him, and,
extending one hand slowly towards the valley that lay
before them, said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I praise Heaven that I have been led, after many days,
to the land that I have seen in my visions. <em>Now</em> do I
begin to understand why they were sent. And you too,
my son,&rdquo; he added, looking at Leonard, &ldquo;you have had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
your visions and your dreams. Tell me, does this not
remind you of them?&rdquo;</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed it does,&rdquo; returned Leonard seriously. &ldquo;Though,
till you spoke of it, I had not thought of it. I felt so glad
to think we had been successful so far, and that your expectations
were being justified. It is all very strange.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am out of all that,&rdquo; observed Jack, with a comical
mixture of offended dignity and good-natured condescension.
&ldquo;You dreamers of dreams have the best of such beings as
I am. <em>You</em> are led on by visions of what is in store for
you, as it would seem, while <em>I</em> have to work in the dark,
and follow others blindly, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And think of nothing but how best you can serve and
protect your friends,&rdquo; said Monella, looking at him with a
kindly smile. &ldquo;We are not all alike, my friend. It is not
given to all to &lsquo;dream dreams,&rsquo; any more than it is given
to all to have true manly courage combined with almost
womanly affection for those they call their friends. We
three have little to boast of as between one another, I
fancy. Would it were so more often where three friends
are found grouped together or associated in any undertaking.
But now to consider what is next to be done.
It seems to me we could not have a better place for our
head-quarters in our future explorations than this cavern.
Here we have all we want: shelter from rain, and sun,
water&mdash;pretty well all we could ask for. We must see
about getting our things along here.&rdquo; He paused for a
moment and then continued, &ldquo;On second thoughts I see
no reason why you should not remain here. There is no
more baggage than the Indians can carry amongst them,
and that is all we have to trouble about. I will go back,
and you two stay here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That seems scarcely fair,&rdquo; Jack protested. &ldquo;I have been
lazy all the morning. I propose I go and leave you here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Monella shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot manage the Indians as I can,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;Indeed, that is one reason why I think you would do
better to remain here. When they find you do not return,
and that they have to obey me or remain in the forest
alone, they are more likely to do what we require. But I
will ask you not to go far away, and not to fire off a gun
or anything, unless in case of actual danger and necessity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not believe that the place is inhabited?&rdquo; Jack
exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can tell?&rdquo; was the only reply, as Monella took
up the lantern and turned away.</p>

<p>Left to themselves, Jack pulled out his inevitable pipe,
the while that Elwood sought, and brought in, a couple of
short logs from a fallen tree to serve as seats; and the
two then sat down in the shade of the cavern-entrance.</p>

<p>Jack was very thoughtful; but his thoughtfulness now
was of a different kind from his late moody silence. He,
indeed, was ruminating deeply upon Monella, who was
every day&mdash;every hour almost&mdash;becoming a greater mystery
to him. He had been particularly struck with his manner
and the expression of his face when they had stood together,
looking out upon that curious scene. In Monella&rsquo;s <em>words</em>
there had not been much perhaps, but in other respects
he had strangely impressed the usually unimpressionable
Templemore. There had been in his features a sort of
exaltation, a light and fire as of one actuated by a great
and lofty purpose, so entirely opposed to the idea that his
end and aim were connected with gold-seeking, that Jack
Templemore confessed himself more puzzled with him
than he had ever been before. Too often, as he reflected,
when a man sets his mind, at the time of life Monella
might be supposed to have reached, upon gold-seeking, he
is actuated by sheer greed and covetousness. But by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
no single look or action whatever had Monella ever conveyed
a suggestion that the lust of gold was in his breast.
Yet, if that were not so, what was his object? Did he
seek fame&mdash;the fame of being a great discoverer? Scarcely.
Again and again he had declared, on the one hand, his
contempt for and weariness of the world in general, and,
on the other, his fixed intention never to return to civilised
life. Jack began to suspect that all his talk about the
wealth to be gained from their enterprise had been chiefly
designed to secure their aid, and that for himself it had no
weight&mdash;offered no incentive. What, then, <em>was</em> Monella&rsquo;s
secret aim or object? What was the hidden expectation
or hope, or belief, or whatever it was, that had led him
into an undertaking that had appeared almost a chimera;
that had so taken possession of his mind as to have
become almost a religion with him; that had enabled him
to support fatigue and physical exertion, privation, hunger
and thirst, as probably could few other men on the face of
the earth; and that had become such an article of faith&mdash;had
made him such a firm believer in his own destiny,
that no danger seemed to have any meaning for him?
Neither storm nor flood, lightning nor tempest, savage
beasts nor deadly serpents&mdash;none of the dangers or risks
that the bravest men acknowledged, even if they faced
them, seemed to have existence so far as this strange man
showed any consciousness of them. Never had they known
him to step aside one foot, to pause or hesitate one
moment, to avoid any of them. He simply went his way
in supreme contempt of them all; and, until quite lately&mdash;till
within the hour almost&mdash;Jack had attributed all this
either to madness, or to an inordinate thirst for riches for
riches&rsquo; sake&mdash;which, as he reflected, would be, in itself, a
sort of madness. Now, however, his opinion was altering.
The liking he had all along felt was changing to surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
admiration. He remembered the calm, unwavering confidence
with which Monella had led them through all their
seemingly interminable difficulties and discouragements to
their present success&mdash;for success he felt it was, in one
sense, if not in another. In the strange flowers and plants
before them, alone, there were fame and fortune, and what
might there not be yet beyond, now that they had in very
truth penetrated into that mysterious mountain that had
so long defied and baffled all would-be explorers?
Monella, he still felt, might be a bit mad&mdash;a dreamer or a
mystic&mdash;but, evidently, he was a man of great and strange
resources. Few engineers, as Jack himself knew, could
have led them thus straight to their goal from the data he
had had to work upon. Yet he showed now neither elation
nor surprise, and in particular, as Jack confessed to himself
rather shamefacedly, no disposition to remind him of his
many exhibitions of contemptuous unbelief. With these
thoughts in his mind, and the remembrance of Monella&rsquo;s
unvarying kindness of manner&mdash;to say nothing of the
way he had exposed himself to danger on his behalf&mdash;Templemore
began to understand better than he ever had
before the affection that the warm-hearted Leonard entertained
for their strange friend, and he became conscious
that a similar feeling was fast rooting itself in his own
heart. In fact Monella was now, at last, exercising over
the practical-minded Templemore that mysterious fascination
and magic charm that had made the Indians his
devoted slaves, and Leonard his unquestioning admirer
and disciple.</p>

<p>Presently, Leonard, who had fallen into one of his daydreams,
woke up with a slight start and exclaimed,</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a paradise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack smiled, and said, &ldquo;I wonder whether it is a paradise
without a serpent, as it is without an Eve? But your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
dreams, Leonard, if I remember, were mixed up with a
comely damsel; and there is none here. I fear we shall
have to regard her as the part that goes by contraries, as
they say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard looked hard at him, and there was evident disappointment
in his glance and tone when he asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you then think this place is uninhabited?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;And I will tell you why.
That stone that closed the entrance from the forest was
placed there by some one, no doubt, and by some one inside.
Yes; but how long ago? A very long time! Hundreds
of years, I should say. It has taken quite that time for
that stream of water to hollow out the little channel in the
rocky side of the cave and play upon the cement until it has
become loosened. The wood outside tells the same tale.
It must be hundreds of years since any human beings made
their way to and fro through the wood, to or from this
place. <em>Once</em> there were many people here; and they were
not ordinary people either, I can tell you. Not Indians, I
mean, for instance. They were clever workers in stone.
That &lsquo;window,&rsquo; as I call it, through which we came in, is
artificial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elwood gave an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I noticed it, though you did not. I have little
doubt that Monella noticed it too. The cavern was
formerly all open, or, at least, it had a large opening, and
I am almost certain its floor was originally level with the
ground outside. If so, the present floor is artificial, and
there are probably vaults beneath. Outside, the stonework
is so artfully done that you see no trace of it; it
appears to be all solid rock; but inside I saw distinctly
traces of the joints. Then, look at these archways, at the
one we are now sitting under! They have been worked
upon too&mdash;to enlarge them, probably; to give more head-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
when the floor was made higher. See! here are
marks of the chisel!&rdquo; And Templemore got up and
pointed to many places where the marks left by the tool
were clearly to be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Elwood, &ldquo;I suppose we shall solve the
problem and set all doubts at rest before many days are
over. For my part I am in a curious state of mind about
it&mdash;half impatient, half the reverse. If it is to turn out as
you say, I am in no hurry to terminate the uncertainty.
This strange spot, the fact that we are really, at last,
inside the wonderful mountain&mdash;these things open such a
vista of marvellous possibilities that I&mdash;it seems to me&mdash;I
would rather, you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I know, you old dreamer,&rdquo; Jack exclaimed,
laughing. &ldquo;You would rather wait and have time to
dream on for a while than have your dreams rudely dispelled
by hard facts. Now suppose we go and take a look
round in the shade over there. We need not go out of
sight of this entrance; so that Monella will find us
immediately he returns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun had now moved so far over that one side of the
valley was lying in shadow, and they strolled out to
observe more closely the new flowers and plants they had
thus far seen only from a distance.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="f8">ALONE ON RORAIMA&rsquo;S SUMMIT.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> Monella returned about two hours later, the
two young men had much to tell him of the
wonderful flowers and plants they had found, of strange
fish in the water, and curious <em>perfumed</em> butterflies that
they had mistaken for flowers.</p>

<p>There were many of these extraordinary insects flying
about. In colouring and shape they resembled some of
the flowers; when resting upon a spray or twig they
looked exactly like blossoms, and upon nearing them, one
became conscious of a most exquisite scent. But just
when one leaned a little nearer to smell the supposed
flower, it would flutter quickly away, and insect and perfume
disappeared altogether. Many of the flowers that
were scattered about the rocks were shaped like exquisitely
moulded wax bells of all sorts and kinds of colours and
patterns, white, red, yellow, blue, etc., striped, spotted,
speckled. So distinct were they from anything the
explorers had before seen, that they had picked some and
brought them into the cavern to show Monella; but he
could not give them a name.</p>

<p>The stream from the waterfall, they found, disappeared
into the ground just before it reached the cavern. No
doubt this was the stream they had seen issuing from the
rock upon the other side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>At the further end the valley began to rise, following
the stream, which came down in a series of small falls or
cataracts. About this part they had found some other
caves; but had not entered them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And most remarkable of all,&rdquo; said Templemore, &ldquo;we
have not seen a single snake, lizard, or reptile of any sort
or kind. Yet this is just the sort of place one would have
expected to be full of them. Nor have we seen either
animals or birds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella told them the Indians still refused to enter the
cave. They all three, therefore, went to the &lsquo;window,&rsquo;
and assisted to get their camp equipage inside, the
Indians bringing the things to the top of the ladder and
handing them through the opening. They preferred,
themselves, to camp outside, and had already made a
fire to cook some monkeys they had killed with bows and
arrows.</p>

<p>When all their things were safe inside, Leonard and
Jack took some fishing nets and soon caught some fish in
the pools of the stream in the canyon. They then made
a fire just outside the cavern entrance, and cooked them
for their evening meal. The fish seemed to be a kind of
trout, but of a species they had never seen before.</p>

<p>Monella expressed his regret that all attempts to persuade
the Indians out of their fear of &lsquo;the demon-haunted
mountain&rsquo; had failed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will neither come inside nor remain outside by
themselves; that is, if we go away from here to explore
farther. It seems to me, therefore, that we ought
to have all our stores brought here before we start,
and then let the Indians go back by themselves. We
may be here for months, so had better get them to
fetch everything we can possibly require from &lsquo;Monella
Lodge.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was Monella&rsquo;s advice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will take two or three days at least&mdash;possibly
more,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;to transport all our stores here.
During that time we must be content to attend to nothing
else, and postpone any further exploration of the mountain.
Besides, when we once start, none can tell how far we
may be led on. Better have our &lsquo;base of operations&rsquo;
settled and secure first. How far away are those other
caves that you saw?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About a quarter of a mile,&rdquo; Jack answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will have a look at them in the morning,&rdquo; Monella
said thoughtfully. &ldquo;It may be wiser to hide some of our
stores and belongings in different places, so that, if any
accident should happen to one lot, the others may be all
right. Eh, Templemore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the very idea I had in my head when I spoke to
you of those other caves,&rdquo; Jack responded. &ldquo;We can
take half an hour or so to explore them in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better take longer,&rdquo; observed Monella. &ldquo;Better take
the day, and do it thoroughly. Much may depend upon
it hereafter. Suppose, therefore, that you remain here
while Elwood and I return to &lsquo;Monella Lodge&rsquo; and see
about packing and bringing some of the &lsquo;belongings&rsquo;?
Then, if we find another journey necessary, you can go
next time, and Elwood and I will remain here on guard.
But we cannot get back to-morrow night. Do you mind
staying here alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; said Jack, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well then; we will arrange it so. We shall
load up our two animals, and perhaps one journey will
suffice after all. Any way, you hunt for the best and most
secret hiding-places you can find. See that they are dry,
you know. There are the three casks of powder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Will you bring them too?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. We may have blasting to do before we
have done with what we have in hand. The extra arms,
too, we will divide, and secrete in different places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see the idea,&rdquo; Jack assented. &ldquo;Rely on me to do
the best that can be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three went back, after their meal, to where the
Indians were camping just outside the &lsquo;window.&rsquo; Matava
looked grave, and shook his head dubiously, when Leonard
told him of the arrangements come to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My heart is heavy, my master,&rdquo; he said in his own
language, &ldquo;at the thought of leaving you to fight the
demons of the mountain. It is not good this thing that
you are about to undertake. Doubtless the demons have
left this place open as a trap to tempt you to enter their
country. When you are well inside they will close it and
have you securely captured and we shall never see you
more. Alas! that my mother should ever have said
aught to lead you on to this terrible enterprise. Better
had she died first. I feel sure, if you go inside there, we
shall never see you again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elwood only smiled, and bid him be of good cheer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall return,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and, I trust, not empty-handed.
And, if so, you and my old nurse shall share in
my good fortune. But, if you think there is danger, why
do you not come with us to help? It is not like a brave
Indian to be afraid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Indian shook his head and sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matava is no coward,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;His master
knows that well. Against all earthly dangers Matava
will help him to his last breath, but to battle with the
demons of Roraima is but madness&mdash;and it is useless.
No mortal man may brave them and live. <em>Some</em> one must
take the tale to those left behind. It is not good that they
should never know.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a nice way of getting out of it, Matava,&rdquo; said
Templemore, who had just come up and heard the last
sentence. &ldquo;But please don&rsquo;t take intelligence of our fate
till you have learned it. Above all,&rdquo; he continued
seriously, &ldquo;do not alarm our friends in Georgetown by any
wild, preposterous&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t trouble as to that,&rdquo; Elwood interrupted.
&ldquo;Our friends know Matava and his superstitions about the
mountain too well by this time. Besides, we will leave
letters with him, to deliver, in case he returns before we
get back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was now getting dark, and the three white men went
back into the cavern to prepare their sleeping arrangements.
First, it was determined to make a more thorough examination
of the side-galleries, and this was soon done, for they
were found to be of very limited extent. In passing the
archway that led into the canyon, however, Leonard
happened to glance out, and uttered an exclamation
which called the others to his side. They also looked
out into the valley, and were as much astonished as at
their first sight of it that morning. It seemed to be
lighted up!</p>

<p>On all sides, high and low, small lights were seen. They
were of various colours, and hung, some singly, some in
groups or clusters. Many drooped over the water, and
were reflected in the pools below. The effect was
extraordinary. The place seemed a veritable fairy land;
and exclamations of astonishment and admiration burst
from each of them while he stood and gazed upon the
scene.</p>

<p>Then they went out to the nearest lights, and the marvel
was explained. The bell-shaped flowers that had excited
their curiosity during the afternoon all glowed with
radiance. Inside each was a small projection apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of a fungoid character, that was phosphorescent. It sent
forth a light nearly as brilliant as that of a firefly; and this
illumined the bell-shaped blossom, which then appeared
of different hues according to its colouring by daylight.
Even those that Elwood had picked, and thrown down
at the entrance of the cavern, glowed with appreciable
glimmer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of some kinds of toadstools and fungi
being phosphorescent,&rdquo; Templemore remarked, &ldquo;but never
of such a thing in flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; observed Monella, &ldquo;if you come to consider the
matter, there is nothing more remarkable in the one case
than in the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The night passed without incident, and all were astir
before dawn, making preparations for the day&rsquo;s work.
After a light meal, all except Templemore set out on their
way to &lsquo;Monella Lodge,&rsquo; while Jack went out into the
canyon to seek for caves and likely hiding-places for their
stores, and to look about generally. He took with him
his usual two-barrelled gun, a supply of cartridges, and
some biscuits and other provisions. Water he knew he
could get in plenty. He also took a lantern to enable
him to explore the caves. Before leaving the &lsquo;window,&rsquo;
as he now always called the entrance by which they had
found their way into the first cavern, he drew up the
ladder, and then, with some difficulty, rolled the stone that
had closed it into its place again. Most likely he could
not have given any reason for this action if he had been
asked; but probably a vague hatred of the gloomy forest,
and satisfaction in shutting it out of view, were what chiefly
prompted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take all I want round to the other side,&rdquo; he said
to himself. &ldquo;I like that side best. It&rsquo;s a more cheerful
outlook.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>He thoroughly explored the caves, and decided that
they were fairly suitable for the purpose they had in view.
Then, quite accidentally, he came upon another that was
so hidden by a tangled mass of creepers that its existence
would never have been suspected. He fancied he had
seen a small animal disappear behind a bush, and trying
with a stick to see whether he could rout it out, he found
what at first he thought was a large hole; but, on pushing
back the creepers, which hung like a curtain across it, he
found a large opening about eight or nine feet high. Inside
was a roomy cavern with many recesses here and there,
like high shelves in the rock, and many short side-galleries.
Just the very place they wanted, he decided. Neither
here nor elsewhere did he meet with any signs of his pet
aversion&mdash;the serpent tribe.</p>

<p>He now began the ascent of the canyon, following
always the course of the stream that came down it. In
some places the way was easy and direct; indeed, as he
could not but remark, there was every appearance that a
well-defined, wide pathway, with steps here and there,
had at one time existed. But in places it was broken
away; the steps cut in the rock had crumbled, or trees
growing in the fissures had rent them asunder. In other
places masses of rock, fallen from heights above, blocked
the road; and, occasionally, the trunk of a fallen tree.
Then he came to a wayside cave, and was glad to rest in
its shade from the heat of the sun, which began to pour
down into the canyon with intolerable fierceness. He had
proceeded so far that he imagined he must be half way to
the top; and he looked up the canyon still beyond him
and at the overhanging cliffs with curiosity, wondering
how much farther he would have to go to reach its head,
and what he would see when he arrived there.</p>

<p>While he sat quietly pondering this question, and enjoying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
a smoke following upon a light lunch, the idea grew
upon him to complete the ascent that afternoon. He
knew that, if he did so, it would be impossible to return
that night, and this meant passing it in the open air. But
that he did not at all mind; he was accustomed to it;
and, since he saw no signs of serpents anywhere, there
was an absence of the only thing that troubled him in
such case. Monella and the others would not return till
the following evening; he had plenty of time to do it in,
and nothing else to occupy his time.</p>

<p>But would Monella like it? Why, however, should he
object? He could do no harm in going to the top and
back. It was not as though the place were inhabited
and he might get involved in any adventures with the
&lsquo;natives.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The more he thus thought about it, the more strongly
did the feeling grow upon him to make the venture. True,
he had not much with him in the way of provisions; but
he had enough for supper and breakfast if he put himself
upon short rations. In the end he resolved to risk it.</p>

<p>Accordingly, so soon as the sun had gone across sufficiently
to shade the path, he started off once more, and
made his way still upwards. He encountered many
obstacles that delayed his journey, but eventually, just
when night was falling, he arrived at what he calculated
must be the top of the ascent. It was a grassy plateau of
a few hundred yards in extent, facing cliffs that rose still
higher and shut out the view and were inaccessible.
Down these the stream still flowed, though much smaller
in volume than was the case below. What, however,
caused him dismay, was to find that he was shut in on the
other side by a belt of forest that seemed to be almost
as dense and impenetrable as the hated wood below. It
was too late to think of going back; there he must stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and pass the night. It was cold, too, up there, and he
had no rug in which to roll himself. In fact, he began to
wish himself back in the cavern, where he could have
cooked himself a good supper and then rested comfortably.
There was not even a view; he had hoped to have a
glorious prospect and, having brought his field-glass,
even that he might be able to look across the forest and
savanna and make out &lsquo;Monella Lodge&rsquo;; possibly see
his friends, who would now be nearing it. Instead of
that, he was shut in upon a narrow ledge beside an unknown
forest that might be full of wild animals of a
dangerous kind.</p>

<p>Altogether Jack felt he had not acted wisely. He went
a little way into the wood; but, finding it very dense, and
fearful of losing his way in its dark recesses, he soon
returned to the clearing. Finally, as it grew dark, being
tired and drowsy after his exertions in climbing the
canyon, he fell asleep.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="f8">VISION OR REALITY?</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> following afternoon, a long train of Indians, with
Monella and Elwood at its head, was making its
way slowly along the tunnel-like road that had been cut
through the heart of Roraima Forest. They all carried
loads, and they had with them, besides, Monella&rsquo;s two
llamas, which were also loaded with as much as they
could carry. All looked more or less wearied from their
long march, and cast many anxious glances ahead as they
approached the end of their journey. When they reached
the part where the path opened and the trees became
thinner, Matava fired two shots, the agreed-on signal to
Templemore; they were answered at once by one from
him, and, shortly afterwards, he was seen making his way
towards them. He relieved Elwood of a few things he
was carrying, and inquired whether they brought any
news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; said Elwood; &ldquo;and you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; returned Jack, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a very curious
and awkward thing. I have come across a large <em>puma</em>
that has taken a great fancy to me, and has become
somewhat of a &lsquo;white elephant.&rsquo; At the present moment
it is looking out of window, anxiously awaiting my return;
and, though it has not yet learned to scramble down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
ladder, I&rsquo;m not at all sure it won&rsquo;t acquire that accomplishment
shortly&mdash;or it may even risk the leap down.
What I am thinking of is the animals you have with
you&mdash;they might tempt it; otherwise, it seems tame and
good-natured enough, and I do not think it will hurt
either you or the Indians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does it seem like an animal that has been tamed,
then?&rdquo; asked Monella. &ldquo;And where did you come across
it? Inside, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. But I&rsquo;ll tell you later. Meantime, can&rsquo;t
we halt the animals here, and keep them out of sight for
awhile? My new friend is as big as a lioness, and of the
same sex&mdash;and would have one of them down in a moment,
if she felt so inclined. You can&rsquo;t tie her up, you know,
without a collar and chain, even if one cared to make the
attempt. I tried to drive her away, but it was of no use;
and I&rsquo;ve been sitting there racking my brains as to what
on earth I was to do when you came, and hoping against
hope that the beast would take herself off.&rdquo; And Jack
looked the picture of comical perplexity and bewilderment.</p>

<p>Meantime, the train had come to a halt, and Matava
and the other Indians crowded round Templemore and
examined him with great curiosity and attention. There
were many strange Indians who had been induced, for a
consideration, to accompany the party, and these were
equally inquisitive. Some came and touched him, as
though to make sure he was real flesh and blood. Since
Jack seemed inclined to resent this, Leonard laughingly
explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can scarcely believe that any man can have
passed a night in the mountain and live to tell the tale,&rdquo;
Elwood told Templemore. &ldquo;Their idea is that you have
been eaten up or captured by the &lsquo;demons,&rsquo; who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
sent back a ghostly presentment of their victim to lead on
the others. So they are anxious to know whether it is
really yourself or a spectral imitation. You may be sure,
too, your &lsquo;lioness&rsquo; will be a matter of serious speculation
to them. She will be looked upon as a familiar spirit, to
a certainty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella had said little; but he now proposed to go on
to the cave at once with Jack and Elwood, to see how
matters really stood, leaving the others to await their
return.</p>

<p>On nearing the &lsquo;window&rsquo; they saw, sure enough, the
head and paws of an immense tawny-coloured animal that
gave a cry&mdash;a sort of half-whine, half-roar&mdash;of recognition
on seeing Jack. The ladder was lying on the ground
outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; he observed with a mixture of mock
gravity and real anxiety; and he waved his hand towards
the animal. &ldquo;Let me introduce you to the &lsquo;Lady of the
Mountain.&rsquo; I only hope to goodness she will behave herself
and receive you in a friendly manner; for, if not, <em>I</em>
have no control over her. I disclaim all responsibility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella and Elwood looked curiously at what they could
see of the animal. It seemed, as Jack had said, nearly as
large as a lioness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a puma,&rdquo; said Monella decidedly, &ldquo;though a
very large one. I never saw one anything near the size.
However, there is no need to be afraid of it; you have
heard me say you need never fear a puma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Jack, &ldquo;and here is an opportunity of
testing your faith in your own theory. I confess, if I did
not already know she was well-disposed towards myself, I
should think twice before I ventured upon going near
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Monella, taking up the ladder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
placing it against the opening. &ldquo;I will show you the
creature is tame and friendly enough. I could see it at
the first glance.&rdquo; And he ascended the ladder and entered
the cavern, pushing the puma on one side as coolly as if
it were a pet dog. Then he turned and called to Elwood
to follow.</p>

<p>Jack also went after them, and found the puma already
on friendly terms with both, much to his own relief; for
he had had misgivings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The question now is what about the llamas?&rdquo; he next
said. &ldquo;Do you think she is to be trusted there&mdash;and with
the Indians?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the Indians&mdash;yes&mdash;though <em>they</em> probably would
object,&rdquo; replied Monella; &ldquo;but, with the llamas, it is
doubtful. So we had best be on the safe side, and keep
them, if possible, out of her sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s wonderfully playful,&rdquo; observed Jack; &ldquo;just like
a great kitten. I&rsquo;ve been playing with her with my lasso,
and she will run about after it by the hour together, just
for all the world like a kitten. If you want to keep her
out of the way on the other side, all that need be done is
for one of us to stay there and play with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let Elwood do so then,&rdquo; Monella decided. &ldquo;He is
tired; and you can come and help unload.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The animal had, in fact, already begun to show a
liking for Leonard, and, when he went out towards the
canyon, it followed him at once. Jack watched this with
some surprise, and affected much disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like the generality of females,&rdquo; he remarked,
&ldquo;inconstant and changeable. Here have I been at the
trouble of capturing the beast, and being worried with her
all day, only to see her transfer her affections and allegiance
to some one else at the very first opportunity!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The unloading was then proceeded with, and before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
dark everything they had brought was placed within the
cavern temporarily, to be moved on to other places, as
might subsequently be determined.</p>

<p>When all had been brought in, the Indians set to work
to cook their evening meal, while Jack did the same outside
the canyon entrance. The hunters had shot an antelope,
and with some of this and some fish a satisfying meal was
provided; the puma lying down and watching the proceedings
with evident curiosity, but with no more attempt at
interference or stealing than in the case of a well-trained dog.
Needless to say she was rewarded for her patience with a
share.</p>

<p>When the meal was over, and Jack and Leonard took
out their pipes, Monella, looking at the former, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have something of importance to tell us. What
have you seen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Elwood turned and regarded Jack with surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what is it?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You have said
nothing about it all this time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack looked a little sheepish. He was somewhat taken
aback, too, by Monella&rsquo;s direct question. It brought to
his mind the query that had often arisen before&mdash;could
this strange being read his thoughts?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know whether I have seen something or
only dreamed it,&rdquo; he began hesitatingly; and seeing
Leonard, at this, open his eyes, Jack went on desperately:
&ldquo;Well, yes! I may as well out with it and make a clean
breast of it! I <em>have</em> something to tell you, and for the
life of me, I cannot make up my mind whether I actually
<em>saw</em> it, or dreamed it&mdash;whether, in short, it was reality, or
only a vision!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard opened his eyes wider than ever, and gave a
long whistle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> having &lsquo;visions&rsquo;!&rdquo; he exclaimed in unbounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
astonishment. &ldquo;<em>You</em>, the scoffer, the hard-headed, prosaic-minded
derider of dreams and visions! Great Scott! Is the
world then coming to an end? Or have the demons of the
mountain in truth bewitched you as Matava declared they
would?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I knew you would laugh at me, of course. And
I feel I deserve it. However, if you want to hear what I
have to tell, you will have to keep quiet a bit. I cannot
explain while you are talking, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not say another word; I&rsquo;m &lsquo;mum,&rsquo; but amazed!&rdquo;
Elwood answered. &ldquo;Now go a-head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yesterday, after you left, I pulled up the ladder
and carefully closed the &lsquo;window&rsquo; by rolling the stone
back into the place, as we first found it. I thought to
myself I would shut out the gloomy forest. Then I went
up the canyon to explore the caves we spoke of, and soon,
by accident, found a new one, so curiously hidden from
sight, that it seemed the very thing we wanted; so there
was no need to search farther. Then I thought I would
stroll up the canyon a bit, and reconnoitre; and I found
another cave about half way up, and, finding the sun
getting warm, went in and had a rest. When it grew
shady again, I thought, instead of coming back, I would
go on to the top to see the view.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! yes. I know you mean I ought to have kept below.
However, no harm has been done, and I could see no
objection to going up and taking a peep from the top. I
had my glasses with me and thought I might even catch
a glimpse of you on your way to &lsquo;Monella Lodge.&rsquo; However,
by the time I reached the top it was getting dusk,
and, after all, I found myself quite shut in by yet higher
rocks on one side that I could not climb, and a thick wood
on the other. There was a grassy knoll of a few hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
square yards in extent, and there I had to make up my
mind to pass the night. I was tired out; and, soon after
it grew dark, I fell asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Templemore paused, and glanced doubtfully at Monella,
as if expecting him to say something; but he remained
silent, and Jack proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seemed to wake up after being asleep for an hour
or two. I say <em>seemed</em> to wake up&mdash;I really cannot say&mdash;but
either that, or I dreamed the whole thing. Well, I seemed
to wake up, and fancied I heard distant shouts. I looked
sleepily round and was surprised and alarmed to see a
very unmistakable glow in the sky through the trees. It
struck me at once that the forest must be on fire, and if so,
I thought, my position might be an awkward one. If the
wood were burning, and the fire travelling in the direction
of where I was, to have to retreat down the canyon in the
dark would be anything but agreeable. After some consideration
I decided to venture a little way into the wood,
and climb a tree in the hope of getting a view of what was
going on. I could hardly, I reflected, lose my way, for,
when I wished to return, I should only have to turn my
back on the direction in which the fire lay and march
straight back. Accordingly, I made my way into the
wood; at first it was very dense, but soon it grew thinner,
and, encouraged by this, I went straight on, when I
emerged on to a high plateau, where an extraordinary
sight presented itself. I seemed to be on the edge of an
extensive sort of basin; I could see for miles; and in the
centre, as it appeared, there was a broad lake, and beside
the lake were lofty buildings lighted up on all sides, the
lights being reflected in the water. There seemed to me
a large city; there were buildings that looked like grand
palaces; there were wide noble-looking embankments and
promenades and bridges, all well lighted; and, on the lake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
boats, also lighted, were going to and fro, filled with people.
I could hear shouts and cries, though of what nature it
was impossible to say; and through my glasses I could
plainly distinguish numbers of people moving about. It
was as though some kind of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> were going on. The
large buildings towered into the air, and their cupolas and
turrets glistened as though built of gold and silver. In
effect, it was a wonderful sight, and how long I stood
watching it I cannot say; but, after a time, the lights went
down and all became silent and dark. I managed to find
my way back to my camping ground, and, while thinking
it all over in astonished wonder, I fell asleep again, as I
suppose. At any rate, when I finally awoke, the sun was
shining and this animal was lying on the grass by my side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! the puma?&rdquo; Leonard asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I was rather upset at first sight of her, you
may be sure. To wake and find oneself in a wild place
at the mercy of a great animal like that is a startler for
any one&rsquo;s nerves, I can assure you. No chance to use
one&rsquo;s rifle or anything, you know. However, while I lay
very still and watched it, not knowing what to do, I saw
it must be a puma, though an unusually large one. Then
I thought of what you, Monella, had told us&mdash;that we need
never be afraid of a puma. And then the beast turned
round and began licking my hand! It stood up, too, and
purred, and put up its tail just like a tame cat; so I made
friends with it and found it was quite disposed to be on
good terms. After a bit my dream came back to me, and
I went into the wood some distance, but could see nothing.
The forest seemed awfully thick, and to get denser at every
step; so I finally came away, thinking I must either have
had a remarkably vivid dream or vision, or that I had
really been the sport of some demons of the mountain such
as Matava and his Indian friends so thoroughly believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
in.&rdquo; And Jack paused, and looked at his two companions
with an odd mixture of doubt and bewilderment.</p>

<p>Elwood&rsquo;s face, while he had been listening, had become
lighted up with sympathetic enthusiasm. It fell a little
at the end of the recital, when Jack made the suggestion
about the &lsquo;demons.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it sounds like witchcraft to hear
you, our own matter-of-fact Jack, who never dreams, make
such suggestions. But, either one way or the other, it goes
to prove that there is something very extraordinary about
this mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elwood looked at Monella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it all?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that our friend ought, in future,
to be less ready to deride those who may have to tell of
strange things, whether dreams and visions, or out-of-the-way
experiences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I admit that to be a just rebuke,&rdquo; Jack responded with
a good-natured laugh; &ldquo;but it does not tell us, all the same,
what your real opinion may be.&rdquo; But Monella had already
risen from where he had been sitting and moved away to
speak to the Indians.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Jack,&rdquo; said Leonard, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you <em>really</em> say,
straight out, whether you <em>saw</em> this or only dreamed it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly, my dear boy, it seemed so natural that I should
say it was real, only for the inherent improbability of the
thing. Then, too, I could see nothing this morning to
confirm it, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; Elwood said dreamily, &ldquo;the Indian tales of
demons that can bewitch you cannot have any foundation?
There cannot be an unsubstantial city of demons to be seen
at night, that vanishes and becomes only plain forest in the
daytime? That is taking us back to the Arabian Nights,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am more bewildered and puzzled than I can possibly
give you any idea of,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;The whole thing is
beyond me; the sight I saw, or dreamed; and then, again,
the behaviour of this animal here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Elwood said, &ldquo;this puma! Does it not behave
as though it were a tame animal used to the company of
human beings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must say that idea has occurred to me more than
once to-day; but the more I think over it, the more hopelessly
puzzling the whole thing becomes.&rdquo; And Templemore,
for the time being, gave it up.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br />

<span class="f8">IN SIGHT OF EL DORADO.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> next morning Templemore, after leading Monella
and Elwood to the hidden cave he had discovered,
set out early with the Indians for &lsquo;Monella Lodge&rsquo; to
bring in the remainder of the stores; and, while there, in
the evening, he wrote long letters to his friends, to be
entrusted to Matava to take to Georgetown. Amongst
them, we may be sure, was one to the fair Maud, who,
amidst all the excitement of his adventures, was never
long absent from his thoughts. His letter to her was
grave, almost sad in its tone. He knew he was about to
set out upon a critical venture, the end of which none
could see, and he warned her not to be surprised if nothing
were heard of them for a long time.</p>

<p>When, the following afternoon, he and his party once
more made their way back through the forest to where
they had left Monella and Elwood, and had halted just out
of sight, those two soon came to meet him in response to
the usual signal-shots. The first glance at Elwood&rsquo;s face
told Jack that he had some important news to impart.
While Monella was greeting the Indians and giving
directions for the unloading and camping, Leonard
whispered to Jack,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been up to the top and have seen all you saw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
It was no dream, old man, but simple reality. But don&rsquo;t
let the Indians hear anything about it, or they would
stampede straight away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack stared in mute surprise, scarce knowing what to
think, whether to be most pleased to have it established
that he was not &lsquo;a dreamer of dreams,&rsquo; or astonished at
the almost incredible fact it conveyed&mdash;that the top of the
mountain was, in very truth, inhabited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the puma?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is still with us. You had better go in and have a rest
and take charge of her, while we see to the unloading.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This Jack was glad to do, and, on entering the cavern,
he was welcomed by the animal with every demonstration
of gladness at his return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! you have not forgotten me then, old girl,&rdquo; he
said, and he patted and stroked the creature. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not so very fickle, then, after all. Now come along with
me for a while&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to have a wash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When all the fresh stores had been placed inside, and
the Indians were engaged upon their evening meal, and
Monella and the two young men were seated at theirs,
Jack asked for further details of the wonderful news
Leonard had briefly spoken of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is substantially a repetition of what you told us,&rdquo;
said Elwood, &ldquo;save that we managed a little better in the
morning than you did. That is to say, we did not go the
wrong way into the wood, as I suppose you did; and
thus, at sunrise, sure enough, we saw the wonderful city,
which Monella avers can be no other than Manoa&mdash;or, as
the Spaniards called it, El Dorado! We saw its palaces,
and towers, and spires, glistening and glittering in the
sun&mdash;a marvellous sight! So, Jack, old boy, you can be
at ease; you are not yet &lsquo;a dreamer of dreams.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your intelligence, all the same, makes me feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
quite dazed,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;Are you <em>really</em> sure
about it? Are you certain&mdash;do you feel confident that&mdash;er&mdash;well,
that it won&rsquo;t all have melted into thin air by the
time we get up there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scarcely. It is too substantial for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it means this&mdash;that the mountain <em>is</em> inhabited
after all,&rdquo; said the puzzled Jack. &ldquo;If so, what sort of a
reception are they likely to give us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that of course remains to be seen. But, meantime,
it is certain that all your clever theories about the
place &lsquo;not having been peopled for hundreds of years&rsquo;
are fallacious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack presently asked Monella what he purposed doing
next.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must put away our stores,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and
then arrange our plans for making our presence known
to the inhabitants, whoever they may be, of the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and then, if they speak the same language that
you have been teaching me,&rdquo; Leonard put in, &ldquo;Jack will
have reason to be sorry he has not stuck to it a little
more, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of late, Jack had practically dropped all efforts in this
direction, particularly during the last fortnight; while
Elwood had neglected no opportunity for using it in his
converse with Monella. Elwood had, in consequence, got
so far as to be able to speak it fairly well; but Jack was
much behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jupiter! But I begin to think there is wisdom in
what you say,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s response. &ldquo;I must do my
best to make up for lost time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The night passed without incident. The Indians
stayed on through the following day, and Matava even
yielded so far as to enter the dreaded cavern, and take a
look into the canyon. Elwood managed to persuade him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to do thus much, that he might take back to his friends at
Georgetown a description of the scene. Matava was
rather afraid of the puma, but the animal was quite
friendly. The Indian evidently believed that Elwood and
his friends were going to their destruction, and would
never again be seen by mortal eyes. However, at
Monella&rsquo;s suggestion, he made for them during the day a
more substantial ladder, which the nails and tools brought
with the stores enabled him easily to do. He also made
some poles or struts to form bars to close the stone from
within, and, with much perseverance, cut slots in the rock
and in the stone to receive them. When completed, and
the struts put in their places, the stone was firmly fixed
and could not be moved from the outside.</p>

<p>Then Monella made another suggestion. He arranged
with Matava a few simple signals that might be made from
the mountain-top by flashing small quantities of powder at
night, and that Matava could, in turn, answer from the
plain beyond the forest, or, indeed, from &lsquo;Monella Lodge&rsquo;.
These signals were simply&mdash;&ldquo;All well,&rdquo; &ldquo;Coming down,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<em>Not</em> coming down.&rdquo; It was deemed best not to risk more
than these, Matava&rsquo;s intelligence in such directions being
limited; and, since he could not read, to write them down
would have been useless.</p>

<p>When, on the last morning, the leave-taking came, the
scene was an affecting one. The Indians were well pleased
with the rewards given them for their services; but they
were, one and all, in genuine distress at the thought of
leaving the three adventurers to what they thoroughly
believed would be a terrible fate. They even besought
them to alter their minds and &ldquo;come away from the
accursed place&rdquo;; needless to say in vain.</p>

<p>Matava, almost in tears, was loaded with messages to
those in Georgetown, should he go back before seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the travellers again; the understanding being that, if he
found they did not return within a short time, he was to
conclude they would remain for an indefinite period, in
which case he would shut up &lsquo;Monella Lodge&rsquo; and return
to Georgetown, and only expect to hear of them when he
came that way again in the usual course.</p>

<p>At last, the Indians sorrowfully set out and disappeared
in the forest, and Monella and his two companions set to
work to distribute their stores and spare arms and ammunition.
It was decided, after some discussion, to place the
larger portion in the secret cave; leaving only a comparatively
small part hidden in the cavern they were in, it being
obvious that the latter was the one most likely to be
searched, if any should be.</p>

<p>In the carrying out of the plan settled by Monella, the
whole of the stores were divided roughly into two parts;
two-thirds, and all the spare arms, ammunition and powder,
being hidden in the secret cave; the other third, including
most of their camping equipage, lanterns, store of oil, etc.,
but no arms, being stowed away in various remote parts
of the cavern by which they had entered from the outer
forest. This was in accordance with certain anticipations
and eventualities that he had carefully thought out. Thus,
if the people of the place should prove unfriendly, and they
were forced to retreat at once to the entrance cavern, they
had there, ready to hand, in addition to the arms, etc.,
they took with them, all that was really necessary either for
a temporary stay or for the journey back to &lsquo;Monella
Lodge.&rsquo; On the other hand, if the inhabitants should turn
out to be hospitable, and invite the travellers to stay with
them, it might be a little while before they returned to the
cavern at the entrance; in the meanwhile it might be
entered and searched by others, who might carry off what
had been left there. But in that case the loss would not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
a serious one to the explorers, nor would the thieves find
any arms or powder.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Elwood went out a little way
into the forest to cut some short poles he was in want of,
when the puma&mdash;apparently finding the new ladder more
to her taste than the old one had been&mdash;scrambled down
after him and disappeared into the wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had better leave the ladder and go on with our
work,&rdquo; observed Monella, when told she had gone off and
not returned. &ldquo;No doubt she will find her way back
presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But they saw nothing of her till the afternoon, when
she came in, bearing in her mouth a good-sized wild pig,
which she laid down quietly at the feet of her astonished
friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Puss,&rdquo; exclaimed Jack&mdash;he had of late insisted
upon giving her that name&mdash;&ldquo;that <em>is</em> an accomplishment,
and no mistake! You can go out hunting and get your
own dinner, can you, and ours too? Well, after this we
need not want for fresh meat, apparently, while we stay
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The meat was not only a welcome addition to their
larder, so far as they themselves were concerned, but solved
the difficulty that had begun to puzzle them, viz., how to
find food for so large an animal. Up to now there had
been enough left over from what the Indians had captured
and brought in; but, since they had gone away, fresh meat
had been growing scarce, and to feed &lsquo;Puss&rsquo; out of their
limited stores of tinned meats was, of course, out of the
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to leave us and go back to your friends,
whoever they are, Puss,&rdquo; Jack had said only that very
morning. &ldquo;We appreciate your society and all that sort
of thing, and shall be sorry to turn you out of doors; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
unless you can crunch up meat-tins and imagine they are
marrow-bones, I really do not see where another meal for
you is to come from.&rdquo; Whether &lsquo;Puss&rsquo; understood this
speech or not, she had certainly settled the question in her
own way, and very quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall go out again, to-morrow, on this sort of
expedition, Puss,&rdquo; observed Jack. And she did; and next
time brought back a small antelope.</p>

<p>This led to a discussion and a good deal of speculation
as to whom &lsquo;Puss&rsquo; might actually belong to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder who owns her, and whether they have
missed her?&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;And I wonder too whether
there are many more like her on the mountain? If so,
why haven&rsquo;t we seen anything of any of the others?&rdquo;
Since, however, no answer could be given to these questions,
the speculation remained a barren one.</p>

<p>After the stores had all been disposed of to his satisfaction,
Monella decided to stay on another day before making
the venture of showing themselves to the inhabitants;
this was partly by way of a rest and partly to give them
an opportunity of studying the plants and rocks in the
canyon. Most of this day he spent in hunting for strange
herbs and leaves; while Jack and Elwood were more
interested, after the first feeling of surprise and pleasure
in examining the flowers had passed off, in searching for
signs of gold among the rocks. They found undoubted
traces of both gold and silver, but in what quantity they
might exist it was not possible at the time to form any
opinion.</p>

<p>Every night the canyon was lighted up in the fairy-like
manner of the first evening; and, during the day, two harp-birds
had visited the valley and enlivened it with their
dreamy music. The travellers also caught sight of two or
three small animals; but did not obtain a sufficiently good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
view to make them out, and Monella particularly desired
that they should not shoot at anything.</p>

<p>Of fish there was plenty; and bathing in the cool, limpid
pools of &lsquo;The Blue River,&rsquo; as Jack had named the stream,
was a welcome luxury.</p>

<p>Finally, having completed all their preparations, the
three, on the morning of the third day after the departure
of the Indians, set out on their enterprise of visiting the
mysterious inhabitants of &ldquo;The Golden City.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They started at daylight, with just sufficient camping
things for passing the one night, heavily laden with spare
ammunition, and taking their Winchester rifles and
revolvers, and one extra gun&mdash;a double-barrelled fowling-piece.
After a midday rest in the cave that lay about
half way up, they reached the summit, as before, at nightfall.</p>

<p>They assured themselves that the strange town was still
in the same place&mdash;had not vanished into thin air as an
illusive creation of the demons of the mountain. Then they
settled down to sleep and were undisturbed during the
night.</p>

<p>When they woke at dawn on the day that was to prove
so eventful, they found that the puma had disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Puss has deserted us,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;She knew she was
close at home and preferred the kitchen fireside, I suspect,
like a respectable tabby, to passing the night out here;
and small blame to her. I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, if we
happen to come across her when she is in the company of
her own friends, to see her pass us by with her nose in
the air with a &lsquo;don&rsquo;t-know-you&rsquo; sort of look. You&rsquo;ll see,
she won&rsquo;t know us! she would lose caste, I expect, if it
were known that she had been away for a week hob-nobbing
with a party of houseless vagabonds like ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<span class="f8">ULAMA, PRINCESS OF MANOA.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> morning broke fine, and the sun rose with a
splendour that was not often seen even in this land
of gorgeous sunrises. As Leonard looked up at the sky
above, with its tint of deep sapphire blue flecked with
cloudy flakes, and cirri tinted with gold and pink and
crimson, he thought he had never witnessed any effect to
equal it. But, when they had quietly passed through the
narrow belt of wood, and stood just within its cover,
gazing down at the wondrous &lsquo;golden city&rsquo; that lay
sleeping at their feet, the three friends remained silent
and almost spell-bound. The scene was indeed one to
which no description can possibly do justice. The sun
was just high enough to light up the glistening towers
and cupolas; and these, and the spangled sky above,
were reflected in the glassy waters of the lake. Beyond and
around all was haze of a rose-coloured golden hue, which
gave to the centre picture the effect of a vignette. From
the upper parts, which showed the clearest against this
background of rosy mist, the various buildings grew less
substantial as the eye followed their lines downwards, till
the bridges and embankments seemed almost ghostly and
unreal, yet strangely beautiful in their airy lightness.
And the picture was so faithfully repeated in the lake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
that, but for the reversal of the images, the line that
divided the reality from the shadow could scarcely be discerned;
while the whole seemed poised, as it were, in the
ruddy-golden haze like a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mirage</i> in mid-air. Just below
them a rocky spur jutted out with clear-cut outline against
the central scene, the palms and other trees with which
it was crowned showing a lace-work pattern of feathery
foliage through which naught could be seen but the golden
mist. This part alone seemed real; the city, with its
towers, its lofty buildings, its bridges, and its lake, seemed
too fairy-like a creation to be indeed an earthly reality.</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of the three who were thus looking out upon this
glorious sight, it would be hard to say, perhaps, which
was most affected by its subtle influence. Templemore,
notwithstanding his affectation of putting on ultra-practical
glasses through which to regard and analyse everything,
had, in reality&mdash;as is not infrequent with such characters&mdash;a
deep undercurrent of appreciation of beauty, whether
exhibited in nature or in the works of man. As an engineer,
he could appreciate the rare grace and exquisite
proportions of the buildings, and of the bridges, viaducts,
and other such works, far better than could Elwood&rsquo;s less
trained mind; and then, his was a naturally generous and
unselfish nature, and&mdash;he was in love. Such a temperament
cannot look upon anything that charms, that satisfies
the senses, without wishing that the loved one were present
to participate in the pleasure and gratification experienced.
And the absence of that companionship must necessarily
strike a chord of sadness and longing. He was one, at
heart, deeply sensible of these emotions; so sensible,
indeed, that he shrank from displaying them to onlookers;
and thus it was that he half unknowingly hid them beneath
a veneer of &lsquo;matter-of-fact.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Elwood&rsquo;s younger impulses, on the other hand, bubbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
up on all occasions unchecked and uncontrolled. He
was of a highly imaginative and poetic turn of mind; he
was not in love, and hence, the vague aspirations of his
affections had as yet met with nothing upon which to rest,
or, as it were, to centre themselves. He was filled with
unformed hopes and shapeless expectations. The beautiful
was not satisfying in itself; it was but a stepping-stone,
an enticing indication of something still more
pleasing yet to be met with beyond, in the indefinite
future. Thus he was always looking forward to an
horizon that lay beyond his ken; while Templemore&rsquo;s
hopes and longings, though they also turned upon the
future, had found, in the being who had won his love, a
settled, definite purpose in life. Not that the latter was
altogether uninfluenced by that spirit of adventure which
always actuates, more or less, young men of his age and
character; though, in this respect, he might be swayed by
somewhat more practical considerations than was the
enthusiastic Elwood. In the breasts of the two, it could
scarcely be but that there was some feeling of exultation
and pride in the consciousness that what they had achieved
was likely to bring them a high reward either directly or
indirectly&mdash;in fame, or wealth, or both&mdash;even though no
sordid, grasping greed mingled with the generous impulses
natural to youth.</p>

<p>And Monella? With what feelings was <em>he</em> swayed
while he silently surveyed the fair city that embodied the
fulfilment of what he had been striving after for so many
years? He was old, he had no children or other kin
(he had declared) to interest himself in. Fame, power,
riches, he despised&mdash;so he had uniformly given his two
companions to understand. None of the motives that
prompted the two younger men seemed to apply in his
case; yet the fact was patent to them&mdash;had been all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
along, since first they met him&mdash;that he had been instigated
by some overmastering idea that had become, as
Templemore had phrased it, a sort of religion to him, a
faith, a belief; that had urged him on unceasingly where
success had seemed hopeless and the difficulties of his
enterprise insurmountable. Templemore, at Monella&rsquo;s
side, could not but reflect upon this now; as he had
similarly reflected upon it when first they had found
themselves veritably inside&mdash;so to speak&mdash;of the hitherto
inaccessible mountain. But now, mingled with Templemore&rsquo;s
admiring appreciation of all these things, there was
a new element in his feelings towards Monella, which he
could only define to himself as one of reverence. He felt
inclined almost to take off his hat, and deferentially salute
the indomitable, high spirit that had led them on to success,
where success had seemed but a fallacious, impossible,
fatuous dream.</p>

<p>But Monella seemed unconscious of all such thoughts.
He gazed out on the scene before him with a countenance
that expressed only a high and simple joy. His tall, commanding
form had never seemed to his two companions
so instinct with dignity and latent power as at this
moment; and in his eyes, when he turned his glance,
with a smile, to meet theirs, there were a kindness, a
benevolence, a magnanimity even, that seemed to fill up
the measure of the feeling of respect that was growing
upon them&mdash;that made them wonder they had ever
ventured to treat such a man as one of themselves. This
strange emotion swayed both of them; they both felt it,
though each thought it influenced himself alone. Afterwards
they found this out by comparing notes; and yet
again, in the time to come, they lived to comprehend that
this vague idea had been something more than a fancy; it
had been an instinct growing out of a solid, though then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
unknown, reason. It signified that the parting of their
several ways, as between them and him who had been
their comrade thus far, had commenced, had been already
entered upon.</p>

<p>For a while they continued to gaze with swelling emotions
upon the wonderful town. Bathed in the light of the
rising sun, it slowly grew more substantial to the view,
and its stately buildings gradually assumed increased
solidity and reality. Their graceful outlines and proportions,
their masterly design and bold execution, the
novelty and originality everywhere apparent, impressed
Templemore with astonishment, just as they delighted and
satisfied the poetic fervour of Elwood. Templemore
presently turned to Monella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never have I seen the like of those structures,&rdquo; he
exclaimed, &ldquo;either in the places I have visited or in the
pictured representations of the most celebrated cities of
the world. Surely this people must be a nation of
architects!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak truly, my friend,&rdquo; Monella returned. &ldquo;I
have travelled the world over and I have not seen the
like elsewhere. But, as I have told you before&mdash;as I
warned you I expected would be the case&mdash;we have here
the chief town of an ancient people; a race so old that the
oldest Egyptian records of which the world has any knowledge
relate to peoples, and times, and things that are but
as yesterday compared to the remote period to which
these people can trace back their history. So is it written
in my parchments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is what we see, that glistens everywhere, truly
<em>gold</em>&mdash;upon the very spires and roofs?&rdquo; asked Elwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say; but it may well be so, for these parchments
of mine assert that gold is the most plentiful
metal of any in these mountains. They say that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
inhabitants used it for common purposes as other nations
use iron; and that, in fact, iron and steel were far less
common than gold and silver. But I think it is time we
started down the slope to reconnoitre and await our opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The plan Monella had arranged was that, after concealing
in the wood at the top the few camping requisites
they had brought with them, they should move down
towards the city through the clumps of trees, keeping
within their cover, till they came to the point where the
trees ended; that they should remain thus concealed for
a time to see what sort of people passed to and fro,
stepping out and making their presence known only when
they saw any one who might be supposed to be a person
of standing or authority.</p>

<p>Following out this plan, the three moved on through
groves and plantations of trees bearing luscious, tempting
fruits of a kind and nature totally unknown to them.
Wonderful flowers, too, they saw on all sides, and many
strange and curious birds; amongst them the harp-bird,
whose enchanting notes came floating every now and then
upon their ears. In due course they reached the farthest
and lowermost clump, and here they were therefore compelled
to pause. So far they had seen no one; but it was
yet early morning.</p>

<p>The thicket within the shelter of which they now stood
was upon a knoll that was not a great way from the lake.
Looking across its waters of turquoise blue, they now made
out that which had so puzzled them before. Moving on
its surface were numbers of white swans of gigantic size;
and it was these, as they subsequently ascertained, that
drew the boats about which had seemed to glide here and
there without sails or oars. They had seen these great
swans through their glasses, but had believed them to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
vessels fashioned in that shape; deeming them too large
to be really living creatures.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Elwood gripped Templemore&rsquo;s arm, and
pointed to some one&mdash;a youthful maiden seemingly&mdash;walking
along the border of the lake in their direction. She
came to within a few hundred yards, and then stood looking
dreamily out over the lake at the towering, palatial
buildings upon the opposite side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; Elwood exclaimed in a whisper.
&ldquo;The face, the form, the very <em>dress</em> that I have so often
seen in my dreams! Can it be possible? Am I awake,
or is this, too, but a vision from which I shall awake by-and-by?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella put his hand upon his shoulder as a sign to
him to be silent, and pointed to other forms approaching
from the same direction. They all seemed to have come
from a great pile of buildings near the water&rsquo;s edge some
half-mile away. It was partially screened by groups of
waving palms and other trees, which hid from view the
entrances.</p>

<p>The new-comers consisted of a tall, handsome man, of a
dark-hued skin, and richly dressed, and a following of a
score or so of men, apparently a guard or escort. They
carried spears that flashed and glittered in the sun, as did
their burnished shields and helmets. These seemed to be
of gold; they wore short black tunics and sandals. They
halted&mdash;upon a sign from the one who seemed to be their
leader&mdash;while he advanced towards the girl. Just then
she turned and caught sight of him. At this she uttered
a sharp cry expressive of surprise and fear; then walked
quickly up the slope towards where the three travellers
were concealed.</p>

<p>The man followed and overtook her when she was about
a hundred and fifty yards from the edge of the wood. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
seized her by the wrist; but she, wresting herself free,
turned and confronted him, regarding him with a proud
disdain, in which, however, fear was also plainly&mdash;too
plainly&mdash;written.</p>

<p>Now that they were closer, the concealed witnesses
could distinguish pretty clearly, through their glasses, the
features of the two who stood facing one another, neither
for a full minute uttering a word.</p>

<p>As to the maiden, she was in very truth a dream of
loveliness. With skin as white and fair as the most
delicately reared Englishwoman, glistening golden hair,
large grey-blue eyes of entrancing and lustrous beauty, a
perfect oval face, and a figure the very embodiment of
grace, she appeared indeed more like the creation of a
vision than an earthly being of flesh and blood. She was
not exactly tall, yet of fair height for a woman. Her
dress seemed of silk; it was rich-looking, but quiet in
colour, and flowing in design. She wore golden ornaments
enriched with glistening gems, and her hair, falling loosely
over her shoulders, was confined by a broad gold circlet
on the head and was cut short over the forehead. And
in her face was an expression of exquisite sweetness&mdash;albeit
now there were distracting emotions mingled with
it. The clear-cut, pouting lip curled in scorn, though, the
while, the eyes showed fear, as do those of the hunted
hare. Timidly she glanced around, as if for aid; but not
a soul was to be seen save those who accompanied the
man she feared, and from them, it was clear, she could
expect no help.</p>

<p>As to the man himself, he was, as has been said, of fine
stature and handsome; but his was not beauty of a prepossessing
character. His dark face expressed arrogance
and cruelty; in his smile was cold, deadly menace; his
haughty features wore a scowl; and his dark eyes fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
blazed with passion. Upon his head he wore a coronet
of curious design in lieu of helmet or other covering. His
tunic was of black material&mdash;silk apparently&mdash;with a large
star worked in gold upon the breast. A belt as of gold
was round his waist, and a short sword and a dagger were
by his side. His hair, full beard, and bushy eyebrows
were jet black; so far as one might judge he looked about
thirty-five years of age. The tunic had short sleeves and
was cut low so as to display his neck, round which was a
kind of necklace; upon his bare arms were bracelets, and
in all these ornaments there flashed, as he moved, sparkling
jewels of large size and surprising lustre.</p>

<p>Then ensued, between the two, a hot discussion or
dispute, though those within the wood were too far away
to understand its purport. The man advanced again and
again in a threatening manner towards the girl, who as
often retreated a short distance up the slope; then, each
time, turned and faced her adversary.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the man seemed to give way to a burst of
fury; with a gesture whose murderous import there was no
possibility of mistaking, he drew his dagger from its
sheath, and tried to seize the girl; but she, eluding him,
turned and ran farther up the slope. The man followed,
and coming up with her, seized her by the wrist, and raised
the hand that held the dagger.</p>

<p>At this moment Monella stepped out from the wood and
called loudly to the assailant, at the same time holding up
his hand in warning; but Elwood, revolver in hand, rushed
forward in advance of him, and levelled the pistol at the
moment when the blade was poised in the air and was
about to be plunged into the bosom of the girl, who had
now fallen upon her knees. He was only just in time;
for the weapon had already commenced its fatal downward
sweep when the report rang out; the murderer&rsquo;s arm gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
a jerk that cast the dagger a distance of some yards, and the
man himself fell backwards with a bullet through his heart.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Page 115.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Elwood hastened to the assistance of the girl, who swayed
as though about to faint; but the sight of the strangers
seemed to rouse her, for she rose to her feet and stood
regarding them with wondering and evidently doubtful
looks. Then she turned her glance upon the dead man,
and shuddered at the thought of the death she had so
narrowly escaped. Looking once more at the three who
now stood in a group a short distance from her&mdash;for
Elwood had drawn back on seeing her rise to her feet&mdash;she
drew herself up with a charming dignity and grace,
and, to the surprise of the two young men, asked, in the
language Monella had taught them,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words were intelligible enough. The inflection, the
accent, or the exact pronunciation, may have been slightly
different from Monella&rsquo;s, but the words rang out clear
enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella stepped a pace or two towards her. His lofty
form seemed to grow in dignity the while he bent his gaze
upon her; and, looking up into his face, she could scarcely
fail to read the true meaning of the glance she met. She
felt its extraordinary fascination, and yielded to its influence,
as so many had before. Her confidence went out to him
at once; and her look, that for the moment had been
proud and distrustful, softened into one of friendly interest.
She bowed her head as though in involuntary respect&mdash;the
respect a dutiful child might show to a parent&mdash;and
spoke again; this time varying the form of her question:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father, whence come you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are strangers from far countries, my daughter,&rdquo;
Monella made reply. &ldquo;We came here in peaceful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
friendly intent, but fate has so ordered it that our arrival
has been marked by the shedding of blood. Still, though
of that I am deeply regretful in one way, I cannot pretend
to be sorry, if, as I see reason to believe, it has saved
your young life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly it has, and I thank you; and the king, my
father, will thank you too; though I know not by what
marvel it was accomplished, nor by what other marvel ye
have come here, you who wield the lightning and the
thunder, who hold men&rsquo;s lives in the hollows of your
hands, and yet speak our language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time enough to explain that, anon, my child,&rdquo; was
Monella&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;For the moment we must know
what yonder people are about to do. Their intentions
seem scarcely to be friendly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This referred to the small company of guards or soldiers,
who were being harangued by one who appeared to be their
officer, and who, when he had ended his speech, formed
them into line, as though for a charge upon the strangers.</p>

<p>The girl turned round and looked at them; and, doing
so, her face grew pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, yes!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I had forgotten them
for the moment. They are the special soldiers of Zelus
whom ye have slain; and their officer will seek to carry
you all before the father of Zelus, the dread High Priest.
His vengeance will be cruel and terrible, if you fall into
his power; but, if we could but get back to my father&rsquo;s
palace, you would be safe; for he would protect you for
my sake&mdash;for the sake of what ye have done for me to-day.
But alas! How can that be? They are many
and ye are but three. Ye have not even swords or spears&mdash;unless,
indeed, ye can serve them as ye have served
this one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fear nothing for us, my daughter. We can truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
serve these others in the same way, if the necessity
unfortunately should arise. But we seek it not; we have
come here, as I have told you, with peaceful intentions,
and we have no wish to signalise our arrival by further
bloodshed. Will you not, yourself, speak to these foolish
people, and warn them not to rush upon destruction?
Tell them we are powerful, and that, in your own words,
we hold their lives in the hollows of our hands. If they
will depart in peace, they may, and bear with them the
body of their chief; but, if they dare approach with hostile
intent, then shall they fall before us, ere even they have
time to come a dozen paces, even as men are struck down
by lightning. Tell them this, and urge them to be
friendly; for we are not of the nature of those who take
delight in slaying. To us, to slay is easy, but abhorrent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl heard this with increasing wonder. She viewed
the rifles (which all three were now handling) with a
curiosity she did not care to hide. She took them for
some sort of magic wands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will perform your wish,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I doubt my
power to stay them, for they are men used to working
their own will, and now they seek your lives in revenge
for this man&rsquo;s death. Indeed, they well know they go to
their own deaths if they return to Coryon, the High
Priest, and bring not with them those who slew his son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned to go towards the soldiers, who were now
standing in two ranks, with spears in rest, awaiting the
word of command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said Monella. &ldquo;If they listen to your words,
they will want to come here to take up the body of their
chief. We are willing they should do so; but it were
better we did not meet, for I do not trust them, and they
might plot treachery. See!&rdquo; And he took his lasso
from where it hung at his waist and laid it in a straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
line on the ground about twenty feet from the dead body.
&ldquo;We will retire towards the wood; and let it be clearly
understood that they must not cross that line nor touch
that cord. If any man do so, he shall surely die then
and there. Let them not think, however, that we retire
from fear, because of their number. But now, my
daughter, take heed lest they seize you. Be sure you
keep near enough to avail yourself of our protection; but
stand not between us and them, lest the lightning strike
your own form in its course. Once launched, it goes
straight to its mark, and blasts all whom it meets upon
its path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But you need have
no fear for me, so far as these people are concerned.
Their chief has dared more to-day than has ever been
known before; but none of these would lay hand upon
Ulama, the daughter of their king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Monella, &ldquo;if you feel sure as to that, do
not approach them, but go thirty or forty yards to the
right, and bid them come near enough for you to address
them from there. For the rest we will answer.&rdquo; And,
with a sign to his companions, he walked slowly up the
slope towards the wood they had left but a few minutes
before.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<span class="f8">A PRELIMINARY SKIRMISH.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> words that had been spoken on both sides in this
conversation the two young men had followed fairly
well; though they had listened in silence and made no
attempt to join in the discussion. On their way back
towards the wood, Elwood was at first very thoughtful;
then he turned to Monella and said excitedly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do we know she is safe, out there alone? And
what will her father, the king, say to us, if harm come to
her? It seems to me we are acting in strange fashion to
leave her thus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patience, my son,&rdquo; returned Monella quietly; &ldquo;we
must avoid the shedding of blood, if it be possible. We
have come here, as I have already said, with peaceful
motives. If violent acts be forced upon us in self-defence,
let us keep at least our conscience clear; let us be in a
position to show that they <em>were</em> forced upon us. Let it
not be said of us that we have come into a strange land
to introduce dissension, and discord, and internal warfare;
and all for no other reason than the gratification of an
adventurous spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Elwood, &ldquo;<em>we</em> have not introduced dissension
and trouble. It is clear enough that a terrible murder
would have been perpetrated had we not been here to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
prevent it. Surely, no one can accuse <em>us</em> of commencing
bloodshed; and, as to the rest, why, what are the lives of
two or three scoundrels like these, the infamous myrmidons&mdash;if
we may believe what we heard&mdash;of a bloodthirsty
&lsquo;high priest&rsquo;; what are the lives of two or three
such wretches, compared with the safety of this gentle,
trustful girl, whom we are leaving now almost at their
mercy? In my view this is one of those cases in which
offence is the best defence. They are showing their intentions
pretty clearly; let us anticipate them by shooting one
or two. That will frighten the remainder, and stop further
hostile action; and, moreover, prevent their coming near
this young lady, or princess, as I suppose she really is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am bound to say I rather agree with Leonard,&rdquo; said
Templemore. &ldquo;I see, clearly enough, we are in for a
fight, and shall have to kill two or three. Why not as
well do it first as last? If, as she says, they are used to
do as they please in the land, and if what we have just
seen is a specimen of their style, pity is thrown away
upon them. And, besides, is it good generalship, Monella?
To attack first would be sure to scare them; but, if they
make a rush, in absolute ignorance of the power of our
rifles, may they not, some of them, charge home? And
then we should have a hand-to-hand fight where they
would be four or five to one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella passed his hand over his face, and answered
almost sadly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a time to be forward in attack, and a time to be
forbearing. If the time come for the former, no man will
ever see me flinch from it. But you know what has been
said, that the shedding of blood is like unto the letting out
of water, and that he who begins it is accursed. If these
people begin it, we will not shrink; but at least we shall
have clear consciences. Now listen to my plan. We must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
not enter the wood, or they will think we have fled. If
they cross the line I have laid down, let each take the man
opposite to him in the line, and bring him down. Then,
if they still rush on, fire once more, and step back into the
shelter of the wood. If they follow, you know what to do;
your revolvers will suffice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meantime, Ulama, as she had called herself, had been
addressing the soldiers. Their officer had advanced to
speak to her, and angry talk had been exchanged, which
those standing at the edge of the wood, with rifles at the
&lsquo;ready&rsquo;, could not hear. But when, finally, she shook her
head meaningly, and began to retire towards them, Jack
Templemore set his teeth and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you so! I knew it meant a fight! We might
just as well have begun it, as let them think we are
afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is yet a chance,&rdquo; replied Monella. &ldquo;They may
hesitate to pass the line I have laid down. In any case,
all we can now do is to wait and see.&rdquo; And, as Ulama
came towards them, he signed to her to step aside, out of
the line of fire.</p>

<p>The officer had returned to his men, and, after a short
consultation with one who seemed to be next in command,
the two ranks advanced, with the slow, measured tread of
a well-disciplined troop, up the slope. On reaching the
dead body they were halted while the two officers examined
it. They had not understood how their leader had been
killed; nor did they understand it now. They had heard
the report of the pistol and had seen their chief fall, but
the report had not been a loud one; and as Elwood had
run forward at the time, for all they could see (Ulama
being between them) he might have hurled a spear at Zelus.
Yet the sound of the explosion had puzzled them, and
stayed them from rushing instantly to the assistance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
their leader. Altogether, they were perplexed. The dress
of their opponents showed them to be strangers. They
appeared to be unarmed, yet had they killed their dreaded
master in the face of his guard. This argued conscious
power; and it behoved them not to be too precipitate.
After this fashion, probably, reasoned the two officers.</p>

<p>If so, the examination of the dead body could but add
to their uncertainty; for they found there a wound they
were quite unable to account for. It was not a spear
thrust; it was not a wound from a sword or dagger. The
scrutiny, in effect, yielded them no enlightenment; but the
sight of the dead body of their leader and of the blood
exasperated both officers and men, and murmurs were
heard, and cries for vengeance. They probably began,
too, to remember what Ulama had suggested&mdash;that if they
went back with the dead body of their chief and without
the slayer, their own lives would be forfeited. And all
this time the strangers stood calmly regarding them,
watchful of their movements, but offering neither to retreat
nor to attack them.</p>

<p>After some further consultation, the one who seemed to
be in command turned towards where the three strangers
stood; flinging down his sword, he stepped forward and
threw out both his hands, to signify that he desired a
parley.</p>

<p>Thereupon Monella also advanced a few paces; then
paused for the other to address him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you? Whence come you? Why do you
enter our land in this fashion by killing one of the greatest
in the country?&rdquo; asked the captain of the guard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The answers to your first questions are for your
king&rsquo;s ear alone,&rdquo; returned Monella. &ldquo;As to the last, we
came in peace, but interfered to save a maiden from being
murdered.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The other&rsquo;s face expressed an evil sneer, and he made
answer:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not usual, with us, for men to throw away their
lives for women. For what you have done yours may be
required. Still,&rdquo; he added diplomatically, &ldquo;I am not
judge nor executioner&mdash;unless you resist me. If, therefore,
you will surrender like men of peace&mdash;as you say you are&mdash;and
will come with me to tell your tale to my master, I
promise you good treatment while in my custody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have had my answer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We seek
your king. We will yield ourselves to no one else.
And,&rdquo; he continued, with louder voice, &ldquo;since you, my
friend, dare to deride us for taking a woman&rsquo;s part,
know that in the land we come from we are not
accustomed to stand still and look on while women
are being murdered. What manner of <em>men</em> are <em>ye</em> who
dare openly proclaim so vile a doctrine? Soldiers of a
High Priest? Guardians of a &lsquo;religion&rsquo; that teaches
things like this? The span that shall be left to such a
being as ye serve is growing short. His power is waning,
his days are even now numbered.&rdquo; He raised his arm,
and extended it towards him he was addressing; then, with
gathering force, and even passion, till he seemed like an
inspired prophet of old thundering his denunciations
against evil-doers&mdash;&ldquo;We came here in goodwill and peace;
we may remain to be a withering scourge to you and him
you call your master. See to it, and take warning!
There must&mdash;and there <em>shall</em>&mdash;be an end of such deeds as
we have this day seen attempted by&mdash;as ye have no shame
in avowing&mdash;the favoured son of your High Priest.
Hence from my sight, ere scorn and anger overcome me!
I have but to move my finger, and you fall dead before
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>For the first time in their knowledge of him Templemore
and Elwood saw their leader, usually so calm and
equable, moved by a passion that was almost uncontrollable.
They glanced at one another in surprise; and
well indeed they might. For whereas, at first, they had
felt almost impatient of his equanimity, and had feared he
lacked the sternness to deal with those they were opposed
to, yet now they thought only how to restrain his sudden
and unlooked-for passion, lest it should embroil them
further than was actually necessary.</p>

<p>But the fire of Monella&rsquo;s rage expired as suddenly as it
had kindled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have heard,&rdquo; he went on, coldly and disdainfully,
to the captain of the hostile group. &ldquo;I have warned you.
I spare your life to give you time to do better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this contemptuous treatment, so far from having
the effect intended, seemed to rouse the other&rsquo;s fury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think not to impose on me by empty threats and
vain-glorious boasting,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I summon you to
yield and come with me. If not, and we have to kill you
in striving to enforce obedience, the consequences be upon
your own heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I say that I have warned <em>you</em>,&rdquo; returned Monella
quietly. He stooped and picked up a stone, then threw
it to within three or four feet of the cord that lay
between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you but cross that cord so far as that
stone, you die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instantly the other took up the challenge. He stepped
back for his sword, then walked boldly forward, Monella
meanwhile falling back in line with his companions; but
the instant the other crossed the cord, Monella&rsquo;s rifle rang
out, and the fatuous soldier fell prone upon the sward.</p>

<p>Then a tall fellow burst from the ranks and, brandishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
his spear, rushed towards the fatal cord; he was
followed by an adventurous comrade; but, e&rsquo;en as they
stepped across the line, they both bit the dust. Then
all the others turned and fled; all save the second officer,
who stood his ground, neither advancing nor retreating.
He remained leaning on his sword, and looked, by turns,
first at his flying men, then at the dead bodies that lay
around him, finally at Monella and his companions.</p>

<p>Monella advanced and thus addressed him,</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is it you stand thus in hesitation, friend? Are
you in two minds, whether to fight or to fly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second officer was a fine-looking young fellow with
features that were not unpleasing. With a steady glance
he looked Monella in the face and answered,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no coward to run away, and no fool to rush to
meet a thunderbolt. Whoever you are, it is plain that
we are powerless against you. But indeed,&rdquo; he went on,
with something almost like a sigh, &ldquo;when I heard your
words I felt no stomach to fight against you, if so be that
they are true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am well pleased to hear you say so, friend,&rdquo; Monella
said, laying his hand upon the other&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;You
have seen what it is in our power to do. I call upon you
to be a witness in the presence of your king&mdash;of all your
people&mdash;that we did not resort to force until all other
means had failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will I gladly do,&rdquo; returned the officer, bending
his head in courteous salutation. &ldquo;Few would have been
so persistent in their merciful intention. For myself, I
know my fate if I rejoin my master; therefore, if you
will accept my service, I would fain join myself to you.
One can but fight and die; better to do so in the service
of such a chief as you, than of him I have lately served,&rdquo;
and he seemed to shudder while he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then the maiden joined them, and he saluted
her respectfully. She looked at him with sorrowful
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is it Ergalon,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that could stand by
to-day and see another man raise his hand to slay the
daughter of his king, and not move a step to hinder him?
Has Ergalon indeed sunk so low as this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words were said in pained surprise rather than in
anger; and in the gentle eyes she turned upon him there
was no sign of aught but mild reproach. But this seemed
to cut him to the heart, when ringing words of accusation
would, perhaps, have failed to move him. He fell upon
one knee and bent his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! Princess,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I well deserve your scorn;
yet knowest thou not how that against my will I have been
forced into this service. Well I know that to ask pardon
would be useless&mdash;the king will never pardon, should this
reach his ears; still less will Coryon. Yet I care not if
thou wilt but grant me <em>thy</em> forgiveness. If these strangers
are thy friends, grant me to serve thee by serving them;
and should this service be even to death, it will content
me that thou shouldst say of me that Ergalon had done
his duty, and redeemed himself in thine eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be it so, Ergalon,&rdquo; Ulama answered, her voice and
manner charged with a sweet graciousness that quite captivated
the three bystanders. Then, turning to Monella,
she continued, &ldquo;My father, I owe you much for what you
have done to-day. I shall try in the future to repay you
to some measure. Meantime you will need friends&mdash;accept
from Ergalon this proffered service. I feel sure, after
what has happened, you may trust him&mdash;even to the death.
I know not who you are, whether immortals, or beings
of like nature to myself, thus timely sent by the Great
Spirit to my aid. But this I know, that I may trust you;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
that you have come to be my friends, and my friends
from henceforth you shall be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would be difficult to convey an idea of the wonderful
mixture of simple gentleness and queenly dignity with
which these words were spoken. Further, it would be
hard to say which of her hearers was most impressed.
She had the art of winning hearts without intending or
desiring it; and few could long resist the fascination of
her presence. Small wonder then if Leonard Elwood had
already fallen incontinently, helplessly, irretrievably in
love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she finished, &ldquo;I invite you to my home,
where my father will bid you welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And these?&rdquo; Monella asked, pointing to the dead
bodies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ergalon will know what to do,&rdquo; she answered; and
moved away in the direction she had indicated.</p>

<p>But by this time a small crowd was on its way to meet
them. Those forming it were, as it appeared, chiefly
her maidens and attendants and a file of soldiers&mdash;her
guards. They looked curiously at the strangers, but,
at a sign from her, fell in respectfully behind the little
party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubtless you marvel,&rdquo; she observed to Elwood and
Monella, between whom she walked, &ldquo;how it comes about
that with all these people to attend and guard me, I was
alone this morning. But for that chance the dead Zelus
had never found his opportunity of saying that he did to
me. He must have been watching for it; perchance had
heard that I sometimes like to steal away alone for a
little ramble. One gets so tired of always having people
around one,&rdquo; she added, with an almost childish wilfulness.
&ldquo;But this will cure me. For the future I shall be
more careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Templemore, meantime, strolling along behind the
others, found himself somehow placed between Ergalon
and a dainty little damsel whose name, he afterwards
found, was Zonella. She was Ulama&rsquo;s close friend, and
was most busy plying Ergalon with questions about what
had taken place. At the noise of the firing they had
rushed out in alarm; then, missing the princess, had set
out to seek her. In reply to her inquiries, Ergalon
gloomily referred her to Templemore, and on this slender
introduction the two soon found themselves in friendly
converse, rather to the increase of their companion&rsquo;s
moodiness.</p>

<p>It was well for Templemore that day that his affections
were unalterably fixed upon a chosen fair one; else,
inevitably, had he lost his heart either to the fair Ulama
or to the dark-eyed, captivating Zonella. As it was, he
was compelled to own that he had never seen two more
fascinating maidens&mdash;save&mdash;save, of course, Maud Kingsford.
In that reservation&mdash;and in that alone&mdash;lay the
salvation of his heart. But this Ergalon knew not;
and since he had long ardently&mdash;but vainly&mdash;sought the
favour of Zonella, he was none too pleased to see her so
quickly place herself on friendly terms with a total
stranger.</p>

<p>But Templemore&rsquo;s acquaintance with the language was
so limited, that his part in the conversation consisted
more in listening than in talking; and his thoughts were
more concerned in observing all that went on around him
than in studying Zonella herself.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<span class="f8">A KING&rsquo;S GREETING.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">During</span> the walk&mdash;which now more resembled a
procession, for they had been joined by numbers of
the inhabitants who had heard the rifle shots and had
come out in curiosity or alarm to inquire into the cause&mdash;Jack
Templemore had observed many pumas that, like
tame dogs, accompanied the people who crowded round
them. They were mostly smaller than the one that had
followed him from the mountain top down the canyon,
though a few equalled it in size. But he looked in vain
for any sign of recognition from any of them; and it
really seemed as though his own jesting prophecy were
being actually fulfilled.</p>

<p>They now arrived at a colossal edifice that reared its
soaring walls and towers high up in the sky. They passed
between its open gates, that appeared to be of gold and
iron, beneath an archway that, far above their heads,
spanned the space between two lofty towers of pink-white
stone. In the courtyard within were many other soldiers.
These, when the party entered, seemed crowded together
in some confusion; but, at sight of Ulama and her
attendants, they quickly formed into lines, in obedience to
hoarse words of command, shouted by officers in gorgeous
blue uniforms, and with white plumes waving in their
helmets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The courtyard was large enough for two or three
hundred men to drill and march about in. In the centre
was a fountain that threw into the air a jet of water that
fell back with a sound of refreshing coolness into a marble
basin, from which rose curious-shaped green plants that
showed in pleasing contrast to the dainty whiteness of
the stonework. Here and there were marble statues, and,
between them, large vases filled with flowering plants.
Above, a broad gallery ran round the enclosure, and from
this a number of richly-dressed people gazed down upon
the strangers as they entered with Ulama. The latter,
making signs to Monella and his two friends to follow her,
proceeded, through lines of soldiers and attendants who
fell back respectfully before her, to an apartment at one
side, outside which all remained save two or three whom
she specially invited to accompany her. Around, were
benches or divans and couches covered with richly
embroidered stuffs; upon these she bade her guests be
seated, begging them to await her while she sought out
the king and solicited an audience.</p>

<p>When she had gone, a sudden silence fell on those she
left behind; a silence that was the more noticeable,
coming, as it did, after the confused hubbub and clank of
arms that had filled the courtyard on the arrival of the
strangers.</p>

<p>The scene was certainly a curious one. The homely,
travel-stained dress of the new-comers contrasted strangely
in its nineteenth-century plainness with the elaborate,
brilliantly-coloured costumes of Zonella and the half
dozen members of the princess&rsquo;s suite who had entered
with her; with the luxurious carpets, rugs, and cushions
everywhere around; and with the magnificence of the
whole surroundings, that spoke more of the sumptuous
luxury and elaborate decorations of a Moorish &lsquo;Alhambra&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
than of what one would have expected in this isolated
city of the clouds.</p>

<p>Monella stood, lost in thought, with bowed head and
folded arms, his rifle, that that day had sent three human
beings to their long account, resting against the wall beside
him. Elwood, whose eyes had followed Ulama till she
had disappeared through the inner door, also stood
plunged in reverie, not noticing aught of his surroundings.
Of the three, Jack Templemore alone seemed alive to
the interest and strangeness of the scene. His keen,
steady eyes were making mental notes of every line of
the architectural designs, as though with the object of
afterwards constructing a like edifice from memory; and,
from the building, they travelled to its furniture and
decorations, and thence, finally, to the dress and appearance
of those of the princess&rsquo;s suite who stood or sat
around. Ergalon had remained outside with many
more.</p>

<p>Presently, Templemore said quietly to Zonella, somewhat
to her astonishment,</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the name of this city?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;do you not know then
that you are in Manoa? Where did you suppose you
were?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Manoa! H&rsquo;m. The same as &lsquo;El Dorado,&rsquo; I suppose,
as the Spaniards called it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of that, or of who you mean by
&lsquo;the Spaniards,&rsquo;&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Fancy your coming
here and not knowing the name of the place! <em>Where</em>
have you come from? I long to hear all about it.
Are all the people there white like you and those with
you? We have always been instructed, by our teachers
here, that only black demons lived in the world beyond
our island&mdash;at least we still so call it; though, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
it is no longer an island; has not been for many, many
long ages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when Jack attempted explanations, he soon discovered
that he knew too little of the language to make
things clear to his companion. He became hopelessly
involved, his descriptions quite impossible, and, in the end,
he had to give it up as hopeless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must wait till I know your language better,&rdquo; he
said with a sigh; &ldquo;or else question my friends, who know
far more of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will wait as patiently as I can until you can tell
me yourself,&rdquo; she answered with an arch look. &ldquo;I shall
like better to hear it from you. I feel, too, a little afraid
of your friend there&mdash;the older of the two. He seems so
proud and dignified.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is anything but that. He is as kind-hearted and
good-natured a man as I have ever known. To-day he
looks more serious than usual, perhaps. You see, we
have had a disagreeable adventure, and do not yet know
what may be its consequences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, all the same, he is a man of great pride and
dignity,&rdquo; Zonella repeated. &ldquo;He might be a great chief&mdash;a
king&mdash;so far as one can judge from what one sees. He
is not of the same race as you,&rdquo; she went on with decision.
&ldquo;He is more like one of my own people. Your younger
friend, too, is not unlike one of our people; though I do
not see the resemblance so strongly there, as in the case
of the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This odd suggestion almost startled Templemore.
Curiously enough, the same idea had struck him several
times during the past half-hour; since, in fact, the opportunity
had offered of comparing Monella&rsquo;s face and form
with those inhabitants he had seen. Except that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
taller than any, there were many points in which there
was obvious resemblance; and Jack began to ponder upon
it as a strange coincidence.</p>

<p>He was also surprised at the confidence with which the
young girl had declared Monella to be of different race
from himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be an unusually quick observer,&rdquo; he said
presently, &ldquo;to distinguish these things so readily. In
my land young ladies do not much trouble themselves&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Zonella laid her hand upon his arm and
leaned forward with a look of fervid earnestness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Who</em> is this man?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What is his name,
and what brings him here, and just at such a time, too?&rdquo;
This last seemed to be said more to herself than to her
companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is called Monella,&rdquo; Jack told her. &ldquo;I know of no
other name; and, as to why he is here, I can no more tell
you that than why you yourself are here. In some things
he keeps his own counsel absolutely, and is altogether
inscrutable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Zonella said this with a long breath. &ldquo;Then,
though he is your friend, and you are here together, you
<em>really</em> know nothing of him. Is that what you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Jack slowly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s rather an abrupt
way of putting it, but&mdash;well, I never thought of it in
that light before&mdash;but&mdash;I really think you have about hit
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! You and he have met by chance, and have
agreed to travel together for a time. And you have let
him bring you here, I suppose, without troubling yourself
to ask him his objects?&rdquo; Zonella went on, still with her
glance fixed on Monella.</p>

<p>Jack opened his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a very direct way of putting things, I must
say,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;But again, I am bound to admit you
are not far out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your other friend&mdash;what do you know of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have known him since he was a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; the girl persisted, &ldquo;he is very different from
you. Are you <em>sure</em> he is of the same race as yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; Templemore replied, laughing. &ldquo;We are
both of a nation that I suppose you have never heard of,
but that makes no small amount of noise in the outer
world, I can assure you. We are both English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then a heavy curtain was drawn back, and Ulama
entered, and with her an immense puma, larger even
than their friend of the canyon, and behind it the latter
animal itself!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; exclaimed Zonella, &ldquo;there is &lsquo;Nea,&rsquo; who has
been missing for several days,&rdquo; and she called the animal
to her. Great was her surprise to see it, after a brief
acknowledgment of her greeting, turn to Jack and his
two friends, with every sign of recognition and delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Puss, by all that&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; Jack cried.
&ldquo;At least, that&rsquo;s the name I gave her,&rdquo; he added, by way
of explanation to Zonella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know her, then? But how can that be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has been living with us for the last week; but
she deserted us last night, and we wondered where she
had got to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that accounts for it. We could not think what
had become of her.&rdquo; And she began to chide the animal
for its desertion of its home and mate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If &lsquo;Tuo&rsquo; had known you were off gallivanting with
strange people, &lsquo;Nea,&rsquo; I fancy he would have come after
you and marched you back.&rdquo; Then, to Templemore:
&ldquo;But how odd that she should attach herself to you like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
that; you must have had some strong attraction for
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not what she got to eat, at any rate,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;In fact, I fear she was half starved. And at last
she got so disgusted at what, I suppose, she thought our
stinginess, that she went off hunting on her own account;
and what she caught she offered, with a splendid lack of
selfishness, to share with us.&rdquo; And he went on to tell
how he first met the animal; Elwood, meanwhile, recounting
the same story to Ulama; and they learned that
the two pumas were named &lsquo;Tuo&rsquo; and &lsquo;Nea.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Presently, the princess gave a sign to her attendants,
and they all followed her from the apartment, leaving the
three strangers by themselves.</p>

<p>Elwood was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are to wait till the king is ready to receive us,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I wonder what he is like, and what sort of
a reception he will give us! What say you, Monella?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The latter turned slowly, and seemed to wake as from
a deep reverie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not what to say, my son; but I am full of
pain at all that has happened to-day. My mind misgives
me that civil war will come out of it; yet we can but try
to do our best, and leave the rest to a higher power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not long before the curtain was drawn aside
again, and one entered who seemed to be a dignitary of
the court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to conduct you to King
Dranoa.&rdquo; And, with a ceremonious bow, he motioned
to them to follow him.</p>

<p>They passed through many passages, across galleries
and large halls, and up broad staircases covered with
thick soft carpet that was noiseless to the tread.</p>

<p>On their way they saw many people of various costumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and appearance, who regarded the new-comers curiously,
but not rudely. Presently they reached a heavy curtain
before a doorway, where stood more soldiers and officers
in brilliant uniforms. The curtain being drawn aside,
they entered an immense hall, its sides lined with people,
but the whole centre part unoccupied. They were ushered
up this hall and there left standing, their conductor retiring
to one side.</p>

<p>They found themselves confronting a high canopy,
beneath which, upon a raised dais, a man, apparently
somewhat past middle age, was seated; they had little
doubt he was the king. He was a man of a fine presence,
and seemed hale and vigorous, though his dark hair and
beard were streaked with grey. His features were regular
and well formed, his eyes steady and piercing; his expression
was not unkindly; but his chin suggested
weakness, a wavering and unsettled temperament. He
was dressed in a long flowing robe, and large jewels
sparkled upon his breast and shoulders, in the belt that
girdled his waist and in the hilt of his short sword. On
his head he wore a circlet that was simple in design, and
scarcely to be called a crown; it was a band of gold with
gems set as stars. Ulama was seated by his side; she,
also, wore a golden circlet in which gleamed, with softened
radiance, one cluster of large pearls. She had changed
the simple dress in which she had been clad when they
had first seen her, and now appeared in a costume that
was fairly dazzling in its richness, yet in exquisite taste,
and well chosen for showing to advantage her graceful
figure.</p>

<p>At her feet Zonella sat, or rather half reclined, and
other members of her suite were grouped around. Upon
the other side of the king stood his ministers and officers
of state, and his body guard, and, ranged around the hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
were many others of both sexes, looking curiously and
silently upon the strangers.</p>

<p>Over the canopy was an immense star wrought in solid
gold. Statues on pedestals were to be seen at intervals,
and, most curious of all, on the walls were well-executed
coloured frescoes depicting battle scenes.</p>

<p>The king rose and addressed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friends, I know not whence ye come, what brought
ye hither, nor how ye succeeded in passing the wood of
black demons and forced your way into our land. In
ordinary circumstances it would have been my duty to
send ye away forthwith, or even to imprison ye&mdash;possibly,
still worse might have befallen. But my daughter hath
told me that ye have saved her life&mdash;a life doubly, trebly
dear to me in that she is my only child. But that ye
came so opportunely on the scene, she who is my heart&rsquo;s
pride would e&rsquo;en now be lying in the cold grasp of
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here he paused, overcome with emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he presently went on, &ldquo;it has been described to
me. I understand, also, that, by some strange chance, ye
speak our language, and comprehend what I would say. We
knew not that there were people outside this land of ours
who were white like us, and, above all, could speak our
tongue. But these wonders ye shall explain afterwards
at your leisure. At this moment not curiosity, but gratitude
inspires me, in that ye have restored my child to
me. There is not one here&rdquo;&mdash;his eyes travelled round
the packed assemblage&mdash;&ldquo;who will not join with me in
thanking ye for that which ye have done. What say ye,
friends?&rdquo;&mdash;this to his people&mdash;&ldquo;Ye have heard in what
dire peril hath my daughter been this day. Shall we not
give to those who rescued her a right good welcome?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this, the hitherto silent crowd burst out into acclamations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
They cheered, they clapped their hands; they waved
banners, they raised their spears and swords aloft and
flashed them in the air; again and again the shouts went
up, till they seemed in very truth to shake the walls.</p>

<p>When, by a motion of his hand, silence had been restored,
the king resumed,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye hear! All greet ye, and <em>I</em> thank ye. Be assured
of my protection an&rsquo; ye have come in peace. But alas! I
grieve to say I am not all-powerful. There are reasons
for enjoining upon ye that ye be circumspect in your going
to and fro, have always with ye the escort I shall give
ye, and visit only places they shall indicate. This is not
the time or place for further explanations, nor is it fitting
I should now hear the wondrous things I doubt not ye can
tell me. I only wish it understood that while I shall give
ye my protection, and that of those devoted to me, ye must
not hope too much from it; and it may fail ye, if ye observe
not the conditions and limitations I have stated; the cause
whereof I shall explain hereafter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While we return thee our thanks, O King,&rdquo; Monella
answered, &ldquo;on our part, also, let it be understood that we
can protect ourselves. The cowardly assailants of the
princess thy daughter fell before us like chaff before the
fire. We could, an&rsquo; we had chosen, have destroyed them
all, even to the last one; but we spared some that they
might noise the tale abroad and warn others of their kind
not to raise their hands against us. Yet do I regret that
it was necessary to kill any. We came in peace and goodwill,
not to maim and slay, or to spread alarm and desolation
through thy land. Yet this was forced upon us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It hath been so told to me. Perhaps, as ye say, ye
can protect yourselves; and it hath been further told to
me how ye wield the lightning and the thunder and blast
your enemies, hurling them to the ground ere they can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
reach ye. For all that, if ye would go about in peace,
and avoid the need for further exercise of your death-dealing
powers, accept the guard I offer. If occasion
arise, and they fail ye, and ye can help in your own defence&mdash;well,
by so much the better will it be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou hast well said, O King. It shall be as thou
hast spoken,&rdquo; Monella returned.</p>

<p>Throughout the interview the king had been eyeing
the commanding figure of the man before him, not only
with great intentness, but also even anxiously. Indeed,
Monella, with his lofty stature and intrepid bearing, his
nobly chiselled features, his bold, unflinching glance,
would have made no unfitting occupant of the throne.
And, possibly, this thought had struck the king, who once
more spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now I would fain know thy name, and what hath
brought thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am called Monella.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monella! It hath a sound as of our own tongue,&rdquo;
returned the king. &ldquo;And thine end in journeying
hither?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is for thine ear alone, O King,&rdquo; Monella replied
with decision, thereby arousing the surprise of all, the
king included. Then, drawing from his breast a sealed roll
of parchment he had brought with him, &ldquo;But here is that
which will in part explain.&rdquo; And he handed the document
to the king.</p>

<p>The king unrolled the parchment, but, as the first words
met his eye, he started; then, growing more intent, he
read on. But presently, in evident agitation, he stepped
down from the dais, placed his hand on the other&rsquo;s arm,
and said in a voice that trembled with emotion,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will speak with thee alone. Follow me into my
private chamber.&rdquo; And, looking neither to the right nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to the left, he passed down the hall, Monella following,
the crowd opening out to give them egress.</p>

<p>No sooner had they gone, than confused murmurs of
astonishment and curiosity burst out on all sides. Elwood
and Templemore, as much taken by surprise as any one,
looked each in the other&rsquo;s face inquiringly; but Zonella
glided to their side and said in a low tone to Templemore,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Said I not that thy friend was no ordinary man?
Monella! Is it not like my name, Zonella? Methought,
the moment my eyes rested on him, &lsquo;That man is a
great man&mdash;a wondrous man&mdash;and he is one of our
people!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<span class="f8">DAKLA.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Ulama</span> also left her seat and came forward to the
two young men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has taken my father by
surprise; else had he bidden you be seated. Nor did I
know that he could not earlier have received you, or I
would have sent my maidens to you with refreshment.
Come now and sit near us, and I will point out to you my
friends that they may be your friends; meantime Zonella
will order fruit and wine for your sustainment. Anon you
will be invited to our table; but meantime you will need
something. We all do,&rdquo; she added, when they made
gestures of dissent, &ldquo;so you will not be conspicuous in
partaking here of what we offer you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pages then entered bearing luscious fruits and tempting-looking
foaming drinks; the former on massive salvers of
pure gold, the latter in chalices of gold and silver set with
gems. The fruits were all new to them, as also were the
drinks; but, on tasting them, they found them to be all
they looked.</p>

<p>The fruits were indeed delicious and refreshing; the
drinks cooling and exhilarating: to Elwood and Templemore
they were as nectar and ambrosia, and they said so,
and asked many questions concerning them. But, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
that the only information they received was a string of
names that conveyed to them no meaning, they added
little to their stock of knowledge.</p>

<p>They now talked freely with those around them; but
found the questions showered upon them from all sides
somewhat more than they could answer, so that Templemore
said at last in an aside to the other,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell you what it is, Leonard; we shall have to give a
public lecture&mdash;or perhaps a series&mdash;and invite as many
at a time as the Town Hall of the place will contain.
Pity we didn&rsquo;t bring some magic lanterns and
dissolving views to illustrate what we have to tell them.
I <em>would</em> have done so if I had only known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They, in their turn, were not less full of curiosity and
interest in all they saw around them. The statuary, and,
above all, the pictures amazed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It upsets all one&rsquo;s notions of history and all that,&rdquo;
said Jack quietly to Leonard, &ldquo;to find this sort of thing in
the so-called &lsquo;new&rsquo; world. We might be back in Ancient
Greece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or Babylon, or Nineveh,&rdquo; Elwood answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
like a dream&mdash;and, strange to say, I have dreamed much of
it before. I keep thinking I shall wake up presently and
find that this city, with all that it contains, has vanished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust not,&rdquo; said Ulama&mdash;to whom the last part of
the sentence had been addressed&mdash;with a smile. &ldquo;I should
not like to think that I, myself, am but a dream. But,
since you speak of having dreams of that which you find
here, know that I have strange dreams also. All my life it
has been thus with me. Of late they have been less
frequent than of yore, and the memory of them is confused
and indistinct; but I know that in them I have seen&mdash;aye,
more than once&mdash;<em>your</em> face, and the face of him you call
Monella.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Elwood regarded the maiden in surprise, and she
continued,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is true. Tell me, Zonella, have I not often
described to thee those I had seen in my dreams; and
did not some resemble these? As to face thou canst not
know, but as to garb and other details?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true,&rdquo; replied Zonella gravely.</p>

<p>But the matter-of-fact Templemore found it hard to
credit this; visions and the like were nothing in his
way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; both said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;me&mdash;a&mdash;I&mdash;myself, I mean; was I there too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Templemore&rsquo;s manner when he asked this question was
so humorously anxious that Ulama laughed&mdash;a joyous,
ringing laugh, the token of a soul innocent and free from
care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I never dreamed of
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; he asked, turning to Zonella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, never;&rdquo; and she too laughed merrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It really doesn&rsquo;t seem fair,&rdquo; said Jack, with an injured
air. &ldquo;Waking or sleeping, my friend has been a dreamer
all his life; when we met with Monella we found he was
one of the same sort; so those two were on terms immediately;
but I&mdash;I am out of it all. Never had a dream in
my life worth remembering. Not only that, but&mdash;as it
now seems&mdash;I can&rsquo;t even get into other people&rsquo;s. I
put it to you, Princess, am I not a little hardly done
by?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus they laughed and chatted, and time passed on,
and still Monella and the king were closeted together. It
was more than an hour&mdash;nearer two&mdash;before the king
returned; and then alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the audience is at an end.
Affairs of state demand my earnest thought, and I must
now dismiss you. But,&rdquo; beckoning the two young men to
him, and taking in his own a hand of each, &ldquo;once more
let me commend these strangers to your care and friendship.
They have rendered me to-day a service that is
beyond price, and in rendering it to me, they have rendered
it to us all. More I need not say, except to charge you
to make their stay with us a pleasant one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He withdrew, and, with his absence, the crowd began to
thin; only those belonging to the court remaining.</p>

<p>And now Ulama spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall hand you over to my good friends here,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Doubtless you will wish to make a change in
your apparel and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately we brought no change with us,&rdquo; said
Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will bring you a choice of vestments,&rdquo; she
answered, laughing. &ldquo;You will surely find something
to your taste.&rdquo; She bowed courteously, and went out,
followed by Zonella and her attendants.</p>

<p>They were now taken in charge by the high chamberlain,
whom they already knew by name&mdash;Colenna. He,
in turn, handed them over to his son Kalaima, a bright-eyed,
fair, talkative young fellow with whom they quickly
found themselves on pleasant terms. He conducted them
to a suite of chambers which would be, he said, reserved
to them. They found there various suits which he laid
out for their selection, instructing them, with much good
humour, in the way in which they should be worn.
These were, so he told them, the distinctive dresses of a
noble of high degree; and were presents from the king
as a mark of his special favour.</p>

<p>Elwood laughed at Jack&rsquo;s expression while he turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
over the various articles after Kalaima had left them to
themselves, examining in turn the white tunic of finest
silk embroidered with strange devices, the cap with
jewelled plume, the heavy belt of solid gold, and the
short sword and dagger; all ornamented with precious
stones of greater value than they could estimate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you really going to deck yourself out in these
things, Leonard?&rdquo; he asked, with a rueful look. &ldquo;Am
I expected to do so too? Great Scott! What would our
friends in Georgetown say if they could see us masquerading
in this toggery?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When at Rome you must do as Rome does, I suppose,&rdquo;
Elwood returned lightly. &ldquo;After all, I don&rsquo;t
suppose it will seem half so strange to the good people
here as would our continuing to wear our present dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal, no doubt, to be said for that
view,&rdquo; Jack said with resignation. &ldquo;And, since it is
intended as a compliment, I suppose we must e&rsquo;en accept
it as such. I only hope I shall be able to keep my
countenance when I look at you&mdash;that is, before the king
and others. At present I feel very much afraid that it
may prove beyond my powers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In their suite of chambers was a bath, with water deep
and broad enough to swim in. A refreshing plunge, a
reclothing in the unfamiliar raiment, and they emerged
from their apartments dressed as nobles of the country.
The attempts, honest, but too often futile, made by
Templemore to preserve his gravity, caused him at times
more personal discomfort than did even the strange garb
but, since use accustoms us to pretty nearly everything
the efforts required became gradually less and less.</p>

<p>But what sobered him, so to speak, the most, was his
meeting with Monella, who was now attired in like fashion
to themselves. The change seemed to have made an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
extraordinary alteration in the man. He looked taller and
more imposing than ever, and in his gait and manner there
were an added grace and dignity. It could now be seen
that his form was supple and muscular as that of a young
man&rsquo;s, graceful in the swing of the limbs and in every
pose. His eyes retained their unique expression that
seemed to magnetise those upon whom they fell; but his
face had a greater gravity than ever, and something of a
majesty that awed Templemore when he noted it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of a truth,&rdquo; he said to Elwood, &ldquo;that man seems to
alter from day to day even from hour to hour. He is just
as kindly, as courteous, and as gentle; just as thoughtful&mdash;yet,
I feel somehow that there is a gulf deepening
between us, and that it is widening, slowly but surely.
Yet not because one likes him less&mdash;that&rsquo;s just it, you
seem to like him and admire him more and more&mdash;but
you feel you do it from afar&mdash;from a gradually increasing
distance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when, later in the day, they sat down to a banquet
at the king&rsquo;s table, and saw Monella seated beside the
king, taking the post of honour and accepting it with the
easy dignity of one who had been used to it all his life;
not only the observant Jack, but the less seriously-minded
Leonard, felt, with increasing force, the feeling the former
had described.</p>

<p>During this repast they learned that the Manoans were
vegetarians; though their cookery was so skilful that such
dishes as the strangers tasted they found both appetising
and satisfying. Not only that, but, as they soon discovered,
these dishes were fully as invigorating and nourishing as
a meat diet. This was due to the presence of some
strange vegetable or herb in nearly every dish; but what
this was they could not then determine.</p>

<p>At dusk, a new surprise awaited them; for, not only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
palace, but the whole city was lighted up by what they
quickly recognised as the electric light. They now could
understand the brilliant aspect of the city as first seen by
them at night from the head of the canyon.</p>

<p>After the meal, Templemore and Elwood went out, with
many more, upon a terrace that overlooked the lake;
where now boats were going to and fro, some paddled by
oars, some drawn by the large white swans. But what at
first puzzled the new-comers were the antics of some who
threw themselves into the water from considerable heights.
Instead of falling almost vertically, as a diver would, they
swept down in a graceful curve, striking the water almost
horizontally, then bounded up and flew through the air
for a short distance, till once more they touched the water
and bounded up again. Finally, when the impetus was
expended, they swam back to shore or were taken thither
in a boat. Of course this style of bathing could not be
practised <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in puris naturalibus</i>, or in ordinary bathing
dress; so they were furnished with a kind of divided
parachute, or twin parachutes, not unlike artificial wings;
with these they could descend from towers and great
heights and with a long swallow-like sweep, striking the
water and rebounding again and again. By practice some
had obtained a wonderful dexterity in this amusement,
and their evolutions would have deceived a stranger,
viewing them from a distance, into a belief that they were
actual flying creatures. Some of the children&mdash;who chiefly
delighted in this pastime&mdash;were very expert at it.</p>

<p>While watching the gay scene before them&mdash;a repetition
of what they had witnessed from afar&mdash;Kalaima came to
say that the king requested their presence in his council
chamber. Following the young man they entered a hall,
smaller than that in which they had first been received,
and found the king throned under a canopy as before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and Monella seated near him. Around the hall were ten
or twelve of his chief ministers and officers, each placed
before a small table, Upon which were ink-horns, pens, and
sheets of parchment.</p>

<p>Standing in the centre of the chamber was a man of
swarthy skin and haughty mien, his expression cruel and
deceitful. He wore a black tunic on which was worked
a large golden star like that displayed by the ill-fated
Zelus. Standing respectfully a short distance behind this
man were two others, somewhat similarly attired.</p>

<p>The leader had just finished speaking when Templemore
and Elwood entered, and he cast at them a scowl that was
almost appalling in its malignity.</p>

<p>The king signed to the young men to seat themselves
beside Monella; then, turning to the man who had just
spoken, said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;It avails nothing, Dakla, for thee to come to us with
messages of this intent, and with presentments, void of
truth, of what befell to-day. Here are the three strangers
who, as thou sayest, opposed themselves to Zelus, the son
of Coryon thy master. They slew him, it is true, and
some of those who followed him, but it was to save my
daughter from his violence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is false, O King! They lie, if they say so! For
our lord Zelus had no thought of violence!&rdquo; This from
Dakla.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If thine errand here is but to charge with falsehood
these three men, I&rsquo;ll grant thee audience no longer.&rdquo; The
kings voice was stern, and his eyes flashed angrily, so
that Dakla trembled, and there was less confidence in his
tone when he replied,</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they are strangers whom the king knows not;
wherefore should he accept their word before our trusted
servants?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it is confirmed by mine own daughter, sirrah!
And if thou darest again to say it is untrue that Zelus
lifted his hand to take her life, thou shalt not return unpunished,
be the consequences what they may!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the king&rsquo;s impressive manner, and still more by the
menace he had thus let fall, Dakla seemed daunted. He
had expected to be able to carry things his own way. He
hesitated, then said in a milder tone,</p>

<p>&ldquo;But even so, they should not have taken the life of
our lord Zelus, but have brought him before <em>thee</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could they do that when he had more than a
score of men with him, and they were but three? Furthermore,
there was no time for parley. An instant&rsquo;s hesitation,
my daughter saith, and it would have been too
late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dakla reflected; then he made a fresh suggestion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will content us if the king remit to us for trial
him who, with his own hand, did slay our lord. If, on
due inquisition, it shall be found even as the king hath
said, then shall he be returned unhurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s face clouded, and his lips curled with scorn
as he replied,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out upon thee, with thy tricks and cunning snares!
Thinkest thou we do not know thy master by this time?
These strangers are my guests&mdash;under my protection!
Hark ye! I say under my protection! If harm shall
befall them, I will seize thyself, an&rsquo; thou comest again
within my reach, or any others of thy master&rsquo;s minions on
whom I can lay hands, and their lives shall pay the
forfeit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thy words will grieve my master, King Dranoa,&rdquo;
said Dakla, with a scarcely hidden sneer. &ldquo;He careth
only for the welfare of the king and of his people. But
how shall there be safety for the dwellers in this land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
if such as these may go abroad and slay at will, and be
protected by the king?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What safety is there now for any, when even the
king&rsquo;s daughter cannot walk near mine own palace without
assailment?&rdquo; the king wrathfully demanded. &ldquo;Hold
thy peace, sirrah! and quit my sight ere worse betide
thee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Monella rose, and, bending towards the king,
said something in a low tone to him; the king, assenting
with a nod, Monella slowly turned his glance upon the
henchman of the priest, and thus addressed him,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the king&rsquo;s permission to send a message of
my own to Coryon, since the opportunity now offers. It
is well that thou shouldst bear it, and better still if thou
takest it to heart. I sent the same message by the murderous
crew that followed at the heels of thy late shameful
lord&mdash;as thou callest him&mdash;Zelus. It is this: that such
things as he attempted will bring down vengeance and
retribution on you all. Bid Coryon take heed and mend
his ways; if not, his doom is fixed. We are but three;
yet, if we chose, and the king so willed it, we could clear
thee and thy master and his brood from off the land&mdash;aye,
ere another sun has risen and set. And tell Coryon this,
by the king&rsquo;s permission we are here, and, as thou hast
heard, under his protection. For that protection we are
grateful, but we need it not. If thou, or any of thy
serpent brood molest us, we will hold you all to such a
vengeance as shall repay the wrongs of others and rid
the earth of you. I sent this message by Zelus&rsquo;s craven
hounds, but my mind misgives me that in their flight they
scarce remembered it; or, perchance, they feared to give
it. Wilt thou now bear it to thy master?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who art thou that dares to send a message of defiance
to the great Coryon?&rdquo; Dakla asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;One who can carry out his words; one who, as the
ally of the king, will bring upon your heads that which has
been so long deserved. One who, though he spared thy
myrmidons to-day, will spare no more. Beware! Attack
us, and we show no mercy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With each succeeding sentence he seemed taller, more
imposing, and more menacing; until the last words were
fairly thundered out, and his eyes flashed fire.</p>

<p>The countenance of Dakla fell before his gaze; he
hesitated, panted, turned to go, then turned back, and
finally, as one who spoke against his will, he said, with
no show of his former mocking insolence,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, I will bear thy message.&rdquo; Then, with an obeisance
to the king, he and his attendants left the place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would give something to know what the king and
Monella talked about so long to-day,&rdquo; said Elwood to
Templemore that night, when they found themselves alone
together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far as I can gather,&rdquo; Jack replied, &ldquo;there is a
grand old feud on here between these rascally old priests,
on the one side, and the king and his followers on the
other; and Monella, I suspect, has learnt enough concerning
it to lead him to back up the king. Well! So
far as I am concerned, I am game to back him up, too,
against such a murdering lot as they seem to be. What
say you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not ask <em>me</em>,&rdquo; Elwood answered with
some surprise. &ldquo;But I thought that you&mdash;well&mdash;that
is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would be rather more slow to get up enthusiasm, eh?&rdquo;
Jack interrupted with a laugh. &ldquo;Not at all. Fooling
about in a dark, gloomy forest, with no apparent end in
view, was one thing; taking part in an adventure of this
kind to help a lot of people who have received us kindly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
is quite another; to say nothing of helping the king, who&rsquo;s
a regular brick, and his daughter, who&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An angel!&rdquo; put in Leonard.</p>

<p>And Jack laughed, but approvingly, and said good-night.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<span class="f8">MARVELS OF MANOA.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">During</span> the following days Elwood and Templemore
learned much of the strange land in which they
found themselves; of its people, of their condition, and
other details. But, since to give every separate conversation,
incident, or other means by which they gained their
information, would be tedious, it will suffice to cite some
extracts from Templemore&rsquo;s diary that summarise the
knowledge then and subsequently obtained.</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p>&ldquo;I am able now to jot down some account of this
strange place and its inhabitants, so far, at least, as my
limited knowledge of its language and other means of
information go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people seem to be amiable, fairly intelligent&mdash;considering,
of course, that they know nothing of the great
world outside&mdash;and generally well disposed. Although
they maintain a small force of &lsquo;soldiers&rsquo; or &lsquo;guards,&rsquo;
and drill and discipline them with as much assiduity
as though they might be called upon to engage in warfare,
yet, as a matter of course, there are no people with
whom they can go to war; nor is there any likelihood
of their having to fight, except amongst themselves. And
this, unfortunately, has not been unknown; moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
there are &lsquo;signs in the air&rsquo; that it may not be unknown
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An unexpected discovery we have made is, that this
mountain is connected with another close to it and called
&lsquo;Myrlanda.&rsquo; The connection is underground, and was
made originally in the course of mining operations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly, <em>once</em> these people were a great nation.
Their arts and sciences, their buildings, their engineering
works, and their knowledge of mechanics, all give
evidence of this; but, since a nation, isolated as this
has been for ages, must necessarily either progress or
retrogress, the Manoans slowly, gradually, but surely,
have done the latter. They have numerous museums
which are full of wonders of all sorts, pointing to lost arts,
lost sciences, lost inventions, lost knowledge of all kinds.
The fact that the demand has fallen off with diminishing
population has led to the discontinuance of manufactures;
though, in the museums, there are evidences that they
once existed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the case as regards chronometric instruments.
Their occupations being desultory, they have little need to
know the time of day; so the use of clocks and watches
has &lsquo;gone out of fashion,&rsquo; and there does not now exist a
person in the two &lsquo;islands&rsquo;&mdash;as they still call these two
inaccessible mountains&mdash;who can make a clock or a watch.
Yet, in their museums they have many ancient specimens
of clocks and watches of various kinds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like remarks apply to many other arts and sciences
and manufactures. The cause is likely to be found
in the fact of their non-intercommunication with other
nations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the most wonderful thing of all, in this land of
marvels, is a plant or herb they call the &lsquo;Plant of Life.&rsquo;
This, I am assured (though it seems hardly credible), if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
taken from time to time in certain forms, combined with
other plants found here, induces great longevity in the
recipients. The king, for instance, who looks between
fifty and sixty years of age, I am seriously told is three
hundred and forty! Yet that, even, is nothing out of the
way here; for&mdash;assuming that they speak the truth&mdash;there
are among the priesthood a few who have lived in
the land one thousand, fifteen hundred, and two thousand
years and more! I should scarcely take the trouble to
write this down, were it not that I find it a matter of such
common belief on all sides that it is impossible to avoid
regarding it seriously. When first these statements were
made to me I sought Monella and reported to him what
had been told me, remarking that I thought it somewhat
in bad taste on the part of my informants to combine
together&mdash;as it seemed to me they must have&mdash;to palm
off such tales upon a stranger. To my utter astonishment,
he replied that he had reason to believe that
there was truth in what I had been told! He had
doubtless heard the same thing&mdash;and he is so quick to
probe to the very root of whatever excites his interest,
and a man so difficult to deceive, that, on receiving his
solemn assurance (I asked for it) that he was not jesting,
I felt bound to regard the matter attentively. I, therefore,
set to work to get at all the facts as well as I could, and
to see and examine the wonderful plant for myself. In
this way I have arrived at the following data:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The plant, which is called &lsquo;karina&rsquo; in the language
of the country, is of a curious delicate, clear, blue tint&mdash;almost
transparent in appearance, and in texture smooth
and glassy-looking as to the leaves. It grows to a height
of two or three feet, and is succulent in character;
exuding freely, when squeezed, a juice which has a very
strong bitter-sweet taste. It is prepared in several ways&mdash;many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
having, it is believed, secret recipes which have
been handed down from father to son from generation to
generation; but they all relate more or less to a tea or
infusion of the leaves, with or without the admixture of
other herbs or drugs. To have the full effect it must
be taken regularly, almost from infancy; indeed, it is so
powerful that those not accustomed to it must take but
very weak doses at first for a long time, till the system
learns to assimilate it; otherwise, it may even act as a
poison. Taken, however, regularly from childhood, it
produces and maintains perfect health, defying all those
usual fevers and diseases that afflict humanity in other
parts of the world, and carrying the body unimpaired in
all its functions&mdash;accidents, of course, excepted&mdash;into
extreme age, without loss of vitality or strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People do not, however, live for ever; there is one
disease and only one that the &lsquo;karina&rsquo; cannot cure. This
is called the &lsquo;falloa&rsquo;; there is also another name for it
signifying the &lsquo;don&rsquo;t care sickness.&rsquo; Those attacked with
it gradually sink, and die painlessly and easily. This
disease, no doubt, must come to all sooner or later; but it
is generally believed that the priests&mdash;and they alone&mdash;are
aware of some way of so preparing the &lsquo;karina,&rsquo; that
they can either cure even the &lsquo;falloa,&rsquo; or keep it at bay
for very much longer periods than other people succeed in
doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is certainly a remarkable fact that throughout the
land disease, in the sense in which we understand it, is
unknown. Consequently, physical pain is almost absent,
save in case of physical injury. Nor is it necessary to
be continually taking the preparation of the &lsquo;karina.&rsquo;
When once the system becomes inoculated with it, as it
were, it is sufficient, afterwards, to repeat the doses at
long intervals; and a traveller, as I gather, might take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
sufficient of the dried plant with him on his travels to
keep him in perfect health for many years in any part of
the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when, at last, the &lsquo;falloa&rsquo; attacks its victim, it
causes neither pain nor suffering of any kind; only
melancholy, and a distaste for life in general; while its
approach is so gradual as often to be unnoticed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is little doubt that the absence of ordinary
diseases exerts a corresponding effect upon the physical
development; and this alone is sufficient to account for a
fact that is very noticeable here, viz., the beauty of the
inhabitants. Both the women and the men are remarkable
in this respect; and probably not in all the rest of the
world put together could so many beautiful women and
handsome men be found as one sees in this small, but
strange country; and this applies to the old, in a measure,
as well as to the young generally. Whether it also
applies to the old amongst the priests, one cannot say,
for they seem to keep entirely to themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As regards these &lsquo;priests,&rsquo; there are two sects in the
country, called respectively the &lsquo;Dark,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Black,&rsquo; and
the &lsquo;White.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The religion of the &lsquo;White&rsquo; priests, or &lsquo;Brotherhood,&rsquo;
resembles, in many respects, that of the Hebrews, save
that for &lsquo;God&rsquo; they use the term &lsquo;Great Spirit,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Good,&rsquo;
or &lsquo;Almighty&rsquo; Spirit. These have, however, now no
influence in the country, and have been exiled to Myrlanda,
where they confine themselves to a small &lsquo;domain,&rsquo; have
few followers and very little communication with the
general inhabitants. The chief of these is named
Sanaima.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chief of the &lsquo;Dark Brotherhood&rsquo;&mdash;as they denominate
themselves, and well they deserve their name,
from all I hear&mdash;is called Coryon; and he and Sanaima<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
are both popularly supposed to be more than two thousand
years old! But, since both these millenarian gentlemen
keep themselves shut up amongst their own immediate
adherents, and seldom show themselves to the people, it
would not be very difficult to keep up a tradition of this
sort without a word of truth to back it. It may be urged
in support of it, however, that we see many going about
who, we are assured, are three, four, or five hundred years
old; and these assert that they have not the true secret
of preparing the &lsquo;karina&rsquo;; this being known only to the
priests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But whatever be the truth as to their longevity, the
&lsquo;Dark Brotherhood&rsquo; seem to be a set of bloodthirsty,
licentious tyrants, ruling the people with a rod of iron, for
the king, though nominally an autocrat, has but little real
power; but his rule, so far as it extends, is mild, and his
people appear loyal and well disposed towards him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The real ruler of the land is Coryon, the High Priest
of the &lsquo;Dark Brotherhood&rsquo;; a man who, though never
seen beyond the limits of his own domain, makes his
power felt everywhere. What I have heard of him and
his chosen band sounds too atrocious to be true; yet I
am assured I have heard only a part; the whole truth is
of such a nature that men shrink from speaking of it to
one another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is said that they have many wives, whom they
choose at will from amongst the daughters of the people;
but what becomes of them afterwards no one knows, for
they are never seen again when once they disappear
behind the gates that shut in the domain &lsquo;sacred&rsquo; to the
&lsquo;Brotherhood.&rsquo; Further, they lay a &lsquo;blood-tax&rsquo; upon the
population for &lsquo;religious sacrifices&rsquo;; at certain intervals
these victims are selected, it is <em>said</em>, by a sort of ballot,
and from that moment vanish like the others, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
fate is never known; or at least no one professes to
know. It is, indeed hinted, that it is too terrible to be
published. One or two who have escaped back to their
homes have, it is averred, died raving mad; their ravings
being of so dread a nature that it could not be determined
whether they referred to scenes actually witnessed, or
were the offspring of their madness. What becomes
of the children of these &lsquo;priests&rsquo;&mdash;or at least of a
large proportion of them&mdash;is also a matter for conjecture.
They cannot well all live, or they would probably
overrun the land. It is darkly whispered that all but a
certain definite proportion are sacrificed. At any rate
they are seldom heard of. Zelus, the one Elwood killed,
was an exception, it would appear. He is described as
the &lsquo;only remaining&rsquo; son of Coryon; but what has become
of his other children, if any, is not known. Zelus had
set his mind upon taking Ulama from her father to make
her, against her will, his wife&mdash;or one of them. Now
it is generally understood that the king and his family,
and the members of his household, are safe from molestation
by the &lsquo;Brotherhood.&rsquo; Therefore, in seeking to force
Ulama, Zelus was offending against the strict law; yet,
such was his insolent contempt for all law but his own
will, that he not only designed to bear her off, but, in his
rage at her resistance and the scathing disdain and scorn
she showed in her refusal, he would have killed her.
And it is quite certain that, had he succeeded, he would
have been protected by his father, so that no punishment
would have fallen on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If, however, as appears from this, even the king&rsquo;s only
child is not safe from these atrocious wretches, what must
be the position of the common people? As a matter of
fact, though they are by nature cheerful, contented and
unselfish, yet over all there seems to hang the shadow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
an ever-present dread, the overpowering, constant fear
that to-morrow or the next day&mdash;this day, even, they or
some of those they love, without the slightest warning,
may be seized and borne off to an unknown fate. All the
information vouchsafed in such a case is that the victim
has been chosen by the so-called ballot; but it is hinted,
and no doubt believed, that, if one of the priests, or one of
their favourite adherents, happen to cast an approving eye
upon a daughter of the people&mdash;be she maiden or wife&mdash;the
&lsquo;ballot&rsquo; is pretty sure to fall upon her before very
long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the awful despotism wielded by these &lsquo;priests&rsquo;
in the name of religion. Needless to say, it is not confined
to the particulars stated. If the priests themselves
are not much seen in public, some of their emissaries and
followers are continually about, and they domineer over
the people and perpetrate many shameful acts of cruelty
and injustice, in almost all of which they are supported
and protected by those they serve. For, though these
wretches are nominally amenable to the civil law, or to be
brought before the king, few, even of the boldest of their
victims, care to risk the after vengeance that they know
would overtake them as the consequence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was these miscreants that the king had in his mind
when he insisted upon giving us an escort during our
sojourn here. And, though our firearms are undoubtedly
our best protection, still, as has been pointed out to us,
we have made enemies who are treacherous and relentless,
with fanatical adherents, who mingle with the people and
might stab one of us in the back without warning, were
they allowed the opportunity of coming near us in the guise
of ordinary well-disposed or curious citizens. We have
thought it, therefore, only prudent to accept the proffered
guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the &lsquo;White Brotherhood&rsquo; one hears little. Sanaima,
their chief, is reputed to be an upright, well-disposed man,
who would, if he had his way, assist the king to put an
end to the domination of the other sect and its human
sacrifices and other evils and abominations; but they do
not seem to have the power, or, if they have, they lack the
resolution to take any decided or practical steps to shake
off the tyranny of Coryon. Nor could it be done without
plunging the country into a civil conflict that might last
indefinitely and be productive of almost endless suffering;
and the king, as a kind-hearted man, shrinks from precipitating
such a calamity. So Sanaima shuts himself up
in his own domain and gives himself up, it is understood,
to abstruse study.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turning to another noteworthy and surprising thing&mdash;the
fact that these people are acquainted with electricity
and the electric light&mdash;it seems that they collect and store
it underground in some way I do not yet understand.
But upon all high rocks are placed metal rods&mdash;lightning
rods, in fact&mdash;and it is asserted that at all times, day and
night, but more particularly when there are clouds around
the mountain, a constant stream of electricity passes down
the rods and is retained and stored in insulated receptacles
constructed for the purpose underground. The effect of
this arrangement is that thunderstorms are unknown here.
The armature of lightning rods draws off all the electricity
from the surrounding atmosphere; and, though thunderstorms
are often witnessed in the distance&mdash;playing round
other mountains, for instance&mdash;yet they never burst over
Manoa or Myrlanda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On this mountain&mdash;Roraima, as we call it&mdash;a name,
by the way, entirely unknown to the inhabitants&mdash;the
city of Manoa and its lake stand at one end of the great
basin that lies within the summit. All around are terraces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of rock rising, one behind the other, till they end in high
wooded crags that form, in fact, the edge of the summit
as seen from outside. Down these crags or cliffs pour
numerous cascades that find their way, eventually, into
the lake; whence they issue again as the great waterfalls
that tumble from the summit&mdash;or near it&mdash;to the base of
the mountain. For though, from a distance, these falls
seem to start from almost the very summit, they, in
reality, burst out from the level of the lake, more than a
hundred feet lower than the highest rocks upon the top of
the mountain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rest of the top&mdash;apart from the lake and city&mdash;is
a country of hill and dale, rocks and woods, very picturesque,
and forming, in places, minor basins, or vales, of
considerable extent and beauty, quite shut off from one
another. I estimate the total extent roughly at a hundred
square miles; but I believe Myrlanda covers nearly two
hundred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of the land in Manoa is given up to cultivation,
save in the form of gardens, or orchards, and groves of
fruit-bearing trees. The lower rocky terraces around the
lake are beautifully laid out in this way. Here, are cultivated
fruits of every kind. The trees are planted in such
a way as to form shady walks and resting-places; beneath
them are seats and fountains that are always playing, fed
by the streams that rush down at intervals towards the
lake. And across these streams are numerous bridges;
some, where the torrents open out on approaching the
lake, are necessarily of considerable width; those on the
terraces above are small rustic structures&mdash;but all are
ornamental, and some of exquisite design. Around the
terraces flowers grow in profusion, partly wild and partly
cultivated. Wonderful orchids, gloxinias, begonias;
orange-groves covered with flowers and fruit; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
gardenias with their deliciously scented blossoms; with
many others that I have never seen before and have not
yet learned the names of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cereal and other crops required are grown in
Myrlanda, which is principally devoted to agriculture;
there also there are numbers of goats, and a kind of sheep,
and large quantities of fowls. Pumas, which are kept as
pets in Manoa, are not allowed in Myrlanda, for they
would play sad havoc amongst the flocks and poultry;
though, probably, they live upon them all the same; for
the Manoans, being vegetarians, never eat meat, but give
the flesh of their animals to their pets. The latter include
cats, of which there are large numbers; some of most
curious kinds. These two animals, between them, it is
said&mdash;the puma and the cat&mdash;have cleared the land of all
wild animals, including serpents; for there is no more
deadly enemy of serpents&mdash;even venomous ones&mdash;than
the cat; and the puma will attack and overcome larger
non-venomous snakes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one, to see these latter great animals playing
continually with the children of their masters&mdash;as may be
witnessed here all day long&mdash;would think they were
naturally of such bloodthirsty instincts. It has been
said of pumas that, with the possible exception of some
kinds of monkeys, they are the most playful animals in
existence. One can certainly see ample evidence of this
in Manoa, for the creatures, whether large or small, old or
young, seem ever ready to start a game of romps with
whomever they can get to indulge them&mdash;whether little
folk or their grown-up elders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The large swans that swim about on the lake, though
very tame, can scarcely be regarded as pets, though they
are frequently to be seen docilely drawing a small boat
about; or a team of them will be harnessed to a vessel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
larger size. They get their own living among the fish in
the lake, and seem able to hold their own with the pumas.
I am told that this comes about from the fact that the
young pumas, being often foolish enough to attack them
in the water, meet with such treatment that&mdash;if they
succeed in escaping drowning&mdash;they ever afterward leave
the birds alone. These swans make their nests and rear
their young on some islands that lie out near the centre of
the lake. Often, towards night, when the sun has
perhaps set for the day on the lake and the country
surrounding it, these birds may be seen in small flocks
circling and whirling in the air, and presenting a very
beautiful sight as they rise out of the shadow, and the
rays of the setting sun light up their plumage. These
are undoubtedly the &lsquo;white eagles&rsquo; that are asserted by
the Indians to be the &lsquo;guardians of the lake&rsquo; on the top
of Roraima.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Myrlanda is honeycombed with mines, but hardly
any are at present worked, the demand for their products
having practically ceased; and such large stocks have
accumulated from former workings that I am told they
are not likely to be reopened for many years. So far, I
have only partially inspected the museums. They are
more surprising than even the people, for they speak
plainly of a wonderful past history. Here are many
strange inventions and machines, the very meaning and
use of which are now but a matter of conjecture. They
contain, too, stands of arms&mdash;spears, javelins, swords,
daggers, shields, bows and arrows, etc., as well as suits
of beautifully wrought chain armour&mdash;sufficient to fit out
a small army. Most of these are mounted in gold, and
many are ornamented with jewels. All are kept bright
and in admirable order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The statues are surprising specimens of art, as are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the bas-reliefs with which most of the buildings are embellished.
Yet there are now no sculptors here, nor any
painters. There are potters, but their work is inferior to
specimens preserved in the museums. In many other
branches of manufacture, also, the artificers of to-day are
evidently unskilful as compared with those of former
times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the museums are also preserved manuscripts of
great antiquity, and interesting as throwing light on the
past history of the nation. Many of the nobles and chief
people can write and read; but, printing being unknown,
their opportunities of keeping up such accomplishments
are necessarily very limited. The materials used for
dress are mostly silk&mdash;obtained from silkworms&mdash;wool,
and linen; the last being obtained from a fibre resembling
flax. In the manufacture of these materials into fabrics
the Manoans are particularly skilful; especially in working
or embroidering upon them all kinds of new and
quaint designs. Their boats, too, that float about the
lake, are exquisite models; so that one can quite believe
that the nation was once, as they declare, a maritime
people, with fleets of ships, or, at least, large vessels of
some kind. In the museums, by way of confirmation,
are pictures&mdash;very cleverly executed works&mdash;of naval
battles; and, in these, large vessels with two and three
masts are represented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is worthy of remark that in all these pictures representing
battle-pieces&mdash;and these are many&mdash;none but white
people are depicted. That different races intermingled in
the fighting is indubitable; but the difference consists in
dress and other details; not in the colour of their skins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a tradition of the Manoans that they formerly
ruled over &lsquo;the whole world.&rsquo; This may be taken to imply
either the whole continent of America, or a large portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of it; but they knew nothing, formerly, of black or red
races; and their archives bear this out&mdash;their pictures,
perhaps, more forcibly than anything else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As regards the buildings, their architectural magnificence
is undeniable&mdash;almost, indeed, defies description.
On many structures gold has been freely employed in
the roofing, and for other purposes where we should
employ lead or iron. They say the gold came chiefly
from Myrlanda, and certain neighbouring &lsquo;islands&rsquo;&mdash;<abbr><i>i.e.</i></abbr>,
mountains&mdash;from which they are now isolated. Gold
cornices, and embellishments, of every conceivable shape
and form, are commonly used for outside decorations; the
very conduits to carry off water being often of gold or an
amalgam consisting largely of that metal, and wrought
into elaborate designs. Indeed, both iron and tin&mdash;and
lead also&mdash;seem to have been much more sparingly
employed than gold and silver. Iron seems to have been
used only where extra strength and weight were required,
and, in the form of steel, for weapons, or for common
utensils, tools, etc.; and of copper there is very little
anywhere to be seen. Silver, even, is less common in
heavy decorative metal work than is solid gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus the tales that Sir Walter Raleigh heard of the
splendours of the ancient city of Manoa&mdash;or El Dorado&mdash;and
that for many hundreds of years since have been
regarded as fables, appear to have been based, after all,
upon actual fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;How</span> I should like to see this wondrous outside
world that you come from!&rdquo; said Ulama dreamily.
&ldquo;The more you tell me of it, the more you whet my
curiosity, and the more I long to see its marvels for

<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; was Elwood&rsquo;s answer, &ldquo;nowhere will you
find so marvellously beautiful a scene as that which now
surrounds us. I have travelled a good deal myself; and
my friend Jack much more; and Monella, where has
he not been? He seems to have visited every corner of
the world! Yet he said to me, but yesterday, that he
thought this the fairest spot on earth; and in this Jack
agrees, so far as his experience extends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since I first came here I have looked upon it from
many points of view; from the water, as the boat drifts
from one side to the other; from different places round
the shore; from various spots on the rocky terraces
above; and these different views I have seen under all
the shifting effects of sunlight, moonlight, and in the
mountain mist. Yet do I find myself unable to decide
which I like the best. Whatever I do, wherever I
happen to be, I see constantly some fresh enchantment,
some new charm, some effect at once unexpected and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
delightful; till I strive in vain to make up my mind which
I admire the most.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was about a week after the arrival in the city of the
three travellers; and Ulama and Leonard were seated
in a favourite boat in which the princess was wont to
spend a large portion of her time. It was, really, a
small barge, of curious but graceful design and elaborate
decoration. Over the after part was a white and light-blue
awning; the bow ran up in the shape of a bird
with out-stretched wings wrought in gold and silver,
and the stern was fashioned like a fish with scales of
blue and gold, its tail being movable, and running down
below the water-line to form the rudder. Upon the
sides provision was made for several oars; but this
morning Ulama and Elwood had put off alone, content
that the boat should drift wherever the slight air or
current might direct.</p>

<p>Truly Leonard had not over-rated the beauty of the
scene around them; scarce indeed would it be possible
to do so. The water was a dazzling blue, yet so clear
and limpid that it seemed more like a film of tinted air
than water, so that the eye could pierce to great depths
where many strange creatures could be seen. The sun,
high in the sky, poured down its rays upon the buildings
and the trees, in some parts lighting up only the tops
and throwing purple shadows over the rest; in other
places, touches of vivid green contrasted with the pink-white
tints of the faces of the buildings; the whole
quivering in the shimmering haze that conveys an idea
of unsubstantiality in what one sees&mdash;a suggestion that
it may be only a mirage that a passing breeze may
dissipate.</p>

<p>Ulama was leaning in contented listlessness over the
boat&rsquo;s side, her hand playing idly in the water. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
shapely arm, bare to the elbow, was a plain gold band
in which was set a single diamond that even crowned
heads might have envied. It flashed and sparkled in the
sunlight with dazzling fire and power. A gold fillet, set
with another matchless diamond, confined her hair, which
fell loosely in wavy tresses round her shoulders. Her
dress was of finest work, its texture thin as gossamer;
pure white with here and there a silken knot of blue.
It was gathered into her waist by a golden zone whose
clasp was hidden by another and even larger diamond.
No other style of dress could have so well set off the
perfect symmetry and beauty of her figure. Thus, bending
in unconscious ease over the boat&rsquo;s side, the young girl
formed one of the rarest models of maidenly grace and
loveliness that could that morning have been found
amongst Eve&rsquo;s daughters.</p>

<p>Yet, probably, to most observers, the purity and
sweetness that looked out from her soft, wistful eyes
would have seemed the chief and most attractive charm
of this radiant maiden of the &lsquo;city of the clouds.&rsquo; And
her gentle, lustrous eyes were the index of the pure and
loving soul within.</p>

<p>No wonder, therefore, that she was, beyond compare,
the best loved, the most honoured person in the land.</p>

<p>She was her father&rsquo;s chief, almost his only, joy. Apart
from her he found but little that gave him happiness.
At the same time he loved his people and honestly desired
to do his best for them; and gladly would he have made
great sacrifices to bring about their emancipation from the
priestly tyranny that oppressed them. But he shrank
from the extreme step of precipitating a civil war; yet
the alternative of allowing things to take their course
and continue in the old groove grieved him deeply; so
much so that his distress had begun to take the form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
settled melancholy. His courtiers, who were devoted to
him, noticing this, themselves became a prey to anxious
misgivings, fearing in it the first symptoms of the sole
incurable disease they knew&mdash;that which they termed
the &lsquo;falloa.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Leonard&rsquo;s last words had started a fresh train of
thought in the young girl&rsquo;s mind, and presently she spoke
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you then mean that you would fain pass your
life with us; you to whom the great world beyond is
known, with all its endless interest? It seems strange
that! Methinks that, were I in your place, I should deem
life here but colourless and childish. For me, certainly,
it has sufficed. I have a father who loves me dearly&mdash;dotes
on me; my mother I never knew. She died when
I was very young. I have kind friends around me whom
I love, and who love me, and who seem to think far
more of me than I deserve. And, were it not for the
sadness in the land, I think I should be very happy;
certainly I should be contented. Yet, now that you have
told me of a spacious world beyond, full of all sorts of
mysteries and unheard-of marvels, I confess I should
like to see something of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To do so would bring you no lasting pleasure,&rdquo;
Leonard answered. &ldquo;If we&mdash;if I&mdash;who have looked upon
these things, have been brought up amongst them, if I am
weary of them, and never care to see them more, and
would spend the remainder of my life here, for you they
would have no attractions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ulama glanced up shyly at him from under her long
lashes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But are you&mdash;would you?&rdquo; she asked with a slight
blush. &ldquo;Would you truly like to stay here all your life&mdash;never
to go back to your own land?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! I <em>do</em> mean that!&rdquo; And there was a fervid
glow in Leonard&rsquo;s countenance. &ldquo;All my life I have had
a restlessness impelling me to seek&mdash;I knew not what&mdash;in
distant lands. All my life I have had strange dreams
and visions; not only in the stillness of the night, but
also amidst the busy hum of day, and in all these one form
was ever present; it hovered round me so that I could
almost see and touch it. But&mdash;and now comes the strange
part of it&mdash;that first day I set eyes on you, the moment
you drew near, I saw in you the living image of her who
had been the central figure of my waking visions, and
held sweet converse with me while I slept. Then&mdash;when
my eyes met yours&mdash;I understood it all! I knew then
what had led me hither; what it was I had unconsciously
been seeking, and wherefore I had been restless and unsatisfied
at home. I knew that in you I had discovered
all I craved for&mdash;the sweet fulfilment of my soul&rsquo;s desire.
And then&mdash;then&mdash;I saw you in the grasp of one who
would have slain you! And my heart stood still, for I
knew that, unless my hand were steady and my eye
unerring, in striving to save your life I might destroy it.
Oh, think, think what must have been my anguish!
Think, how&mdash;&mdash;Ah! never will you know a tenth of what I
suffered in that brief space; or my relief and thankfulness
when I saw him fall, and you stand scatheless!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young girl looked shyly at him; then, noting the
love-light in his eyes, and the glowing flush upon his
cheeks, the while he had poured out all that he had felt
for her, an answering blush stole over her own fair cheek;
while a coy, dainty little smile seemed to flit airily around
her mouth, setting into little dimples first here then
there; in like manner as a ray of light, reflected from a
mirror, will dance coquettishly to and fro in obedience to
the hand that moves the glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>There was silence for a space, she gazing downwards
at the water, but now and then stealing a shy glance at
her companion.</p>

<p>Then another line of thought passed over her mind and
shadowed her face for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she said with touching innocence, &ldquo;what
people see in me to like so much? I fear it is not
always well that this should be. It was that which led&mdash;Zelus&rdquo;&mdash;she
shivered at the name&mdash;&ldquo;to thrust himself
upon, and at last threaten me, and has placed you in
danger for having slain him. It is very strange! To
like, to love, should mean naught but happiness and
loving-kindness and innocent delight; yet here it has
led a man to attempt an awful crime, and has placed
others in great peril.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not <em>love</em> on that man&rsquo;s part,&rdquo; said Leonard,
savagely, between his teeth. &ldquo;At least, not the sort of
love that urged <em>me</em> on, that has guided me&mdash;even as the
unwinding of a clue leads the traveller through the
maze&mdash;to the side of her I loved and worshipped in my
visions. Mine is not the love that could ever do its object
hurt; that could ever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused abruptly, seeing her glance up at him with a
look of wonder on her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You love me?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;But that is past
believing! &rsquo;Tis but a few days since you first saw me.
You cannot know what I am really like! How then can
you <em>love</em> me? I love my father because he has cared for
me and loved me all my life; I love Zonella&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;other
friends, because I have known them for so long,
and they have been kind and good to me. How can you
yet tell that you will love me? Perchance when you
know me better you may even come to hate me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ulama! What is that you say?&rdquo; he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
impetuously. &ldquo;You cannot mean it! You are playing
with me! But it is cruel play! The love I mean is not
such as the slow growth of a child&rsquo;s affection for a parent
or a girl-friend. It is a swift, resistless passion, that
centres on one being above all others in the world, and
says, &lsquo;This one only do I love; this one possesses all
my heart and soul! From this one I can never swerve&mdash;my
love will end only when my heart no longer beats;
I cannot live without it.&rsquo; Such a love bursts forth
spontaneously from the heart, as does a tiny spring from
the earth&rsquo;s bosom and that, when once it has found vent,
for ever bubbles up fresh and clear and pure, and, commencing
in a little rill, increases to a torrent whose force
no power can stem. <em>That</em> is the love I mean; and &rsquo;tis
such a love I bear for you, Ulama. Can you not
understand something of all this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; replied the maiden in a low voice, and
glancing timidly at him. &ldquo;You frighten me a little&mdash;or
you would, but that I like you too well to feel afraid of
you&mdash;but&mdash;I have no knowledge of such love as you
describe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, you have <em>heard</em> of a love that far exceeds mere
friendship&mdash;far stronger than affection?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-es. I have <em>heard</em> of it; and&mdash;ridiculed it as fiction.
Yet&mdash;if you affirm its truth, and in your own person have
experienced it&mdash;I must fain believe you, for I know you
would not say what is not true. But&rdquo;&mdash;here she sagely
shook her head&mdash;&ldquo;though my ears receive your words,
the time has not yet come when they have reached my
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard seized her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, meanwhile, I have not offended you, Ulama?&rdquo;
he asked entreatingly. &ldquo;You will let me love you?
Indeed, I am powerless to help it. And you will try to&mdash;to&mdash;like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
me&mdash;ah, you have said you <em>do</em> like me already.
Will you not try to love me a little?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she frankly answered, &ldquo;you would not surely
have me <em>try</em>? What sort of love would that be that we
had to <em>try</em> to bring into being&mdash;to force upon an unresponsive
heart? You have said that it should burst
forth spontaneously. I scarcely understand when you
speak thus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right, Ulama, as you ever are; and I am
wrong; but my love makes me impatient. I will not
expect too much of you. I will wait with such content
as is in me to command until your gentle heart shall beat
in unison with mine; and something in me tells me that
one day it will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then they heard the voice of some one calling
to them, and, looking round, they saw Jack Templemore
and Zonella, with several others, coming towards them in
another boat.</p>

<p>When they were within speaking distance, Jack said
that Monella had sent him to tell Leonard he wished to
speak to him; Leonard accordingly took up the oars
and rowed the barge slowly to shore. There he left
Ulama with the party, and proceeded in search of Monella
who, he had been told, was awaiting him upon a terrace
that overlooked the lake.</p>

<p>Here Leonard found him seated with a field-glass in
his hand. Monella turned and looked searchingly at the
young man, who felt himself colouring under the other&rsquo;s
glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love not to seem to spy upon your acts, my son,&rdquo;
Monella began gravely, &ldquo;but when I caught sight of
you in yonder boat holding the hand of the princess,
the daughter of the king, who is our kind and gracious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
host, I could not well do otherwise than seek a talk
with you. I fear you have not well considered what
you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this rebuke Leonard coloured up still more, albeit
the words were spoken with evident kindness. For that
very reason, probably, they sank the deeper. It was
the first time anything savouring of reproof to him had
fallen from Monella&rsquo;s lips; and, up to that moment, its
possibility had seemed remote; and now the young man
deeply felt the fact that the other should have thought it
necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I know what you would say,&rdquo; he answered in
a low voice. &ldquo;I feel I have been wrong&mdash;guilty of
thoughtlessness, presumption, and seemingly of breach of
confidence. I understand what is in your mind. Yet let
me say at once that so far little&mdash;practically nothing&mdash;has
been said, and nothing more shall be&mdash;unless&mdash;you can tell
me I dare hope. But oh, my good friend, you who have
treated me always as a son, and shown such sympathy
and kindness towards me&mdash;who have known of my half-formed
aspirations, and the ideas that led me on and
ended in my coming here, and encouraged me in those
ideas&mdash;who have learned that in the king&rsquo;s daughter I
have found the living embodiment of the central figure of
all my dreamings&mdash;<em>you</em> surely will not now turn upon me
and tell me I must stifle all my feelings, and&mdash;give&mdash;up&mdash;the
hopes&mdash;that had arisen&mdash;in my heart?&rdquo; And Leonard
sank wearily into a seat.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time realising his actual position,
how next to impossible it was that the king would regard
with favour his pretensions, he placed his hands before
his face and groaned aloud.</p>

<p>Monella rose, and, going to him, laid his hand kindly
upon his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I might bring all the arguments and platitudes of the
&lsquo;worldly-wise&rsquo; to bear on you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I forbear;
and I know they will not weigh with you. Moreover, it
is undeniable that the circumstances are unusual and unlooked-for.
But they do not justify you in forgetting what
you owe to a kingly host and&mdash;I may add&mdash;to others; to
us, your friends, for instance. You know, also, that our
position here is critical; there is trouble brewing in the
land. If the king should have reason to believe that one
of us has abused his confidence in one matter, he may
lose his trust in all, as touching other, and far more
weighty matters&mdash;matters that may affect even his own
personal security; to say nothing of our own lives, and
those of many of his subjects. Therefore&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard sprang up and looked at him imploringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake say no more,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or I shall
begin to hate myself. I understand&mdash;only too well.
Trust me&mdash;if you will; if you feel you can; if you have
not lost confidence. You shall not have further reason
for complaint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella took Leonard&rsquo;s hand in his and pressed it
affectionately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well, my son,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have full confidence,
and will trust you. And you, on your side, must trust
me. I may have opportunity to sound the king, and, if
it so happen, you may count on me to say and do all
that my friendship for you may dictate&mdash;and that will
not be a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard wrung the other&rsquo;s hand and tried to thank
him, but a burst of emotion overcame him, and he turned
away. When he again looked round he was alone.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<span class="f8">THE FIGHT ON THE HILLSIDE.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> had become the custom of the two young men to
go every morning, when the atmosphere was clear,
to a height at one end of the valley, from which a view
could be obtained over the whole country surrounding
that end of Roraima. The spot was a level table of rock
under a picturesque group of fir-trees&mdash;for on the upper
cliffs fir-trees were numerous&mdash;and from it, looking in the
direction farthest from the mountain, the view was grand
in the extreme; while, on the other side of them was
the great valley or basin in which lay the lake and the
city of Manoa.</p>

<p>It would be but labour lost to attempt to give an
adequate idea of the prospect over which the eye could
travel on a clear day, when one stood upon this giddy
height. It extended to an almost illimitable distance;
for, when one looked beyond the surrounding mountains
of the Roraima range, there were no more hills to break
the view till it reached the far distant Andes, had these
been visible. Indeed, it was said that they <em>were</em> visible
on a few days in the year; but, if that were so, it would
perhaps be rather as an effect in the nature of a mirage
than what is usually understood by an actual view of the
far-away mountains. But nearer at hand, in other directions
were mountain ridges and summits in seemingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
endless succession, piled up in extraordinary confusion.
From Roraima, as the highest of all, one could look down,
to some extent, upon the others. Myrlanda was upon
the other side, but Marima, and others of the strange
group, lay before the eye, and one could see the woods
and lakes upon their summits; but enough could not be
seen to enable the spectator to decide whether they
might be inhabited or not.</p>

<p>The beauty of the expanse of tropical vegetation immediately
below was indeed marvellous. Here the explorers
gazed down upon the tops of the trees of the
gloomy forest that girdled the mountain (though not that
part through which they had made their way with so
much wearying, but dogged perseverance), and lo! it was
a veritable garden of flowers of brilliant hue! For the
trees beneath which they had crept, like ants among the
stems of a field of clover, were gorgeous above in their
display of blossoms, while shutting out the light from
those who walked below.</p>

<p>Here and there, amid the green, the great cascades
and torrents from the mountain side dashed impetuously
from rock to rock; the streams that were in fact some
of the feeders of the greatest of all rivers, the mighty
Amazon; that river of wondrous mysteries, that pursues
its course of four thousand miles through the plains of
Brazil, and finds its way round at last into the Atlantic,
there to hurl the volume of its waters with such force into
the sea, that even the ocean waters are pushed aside to
make a path for them hundreds of miles from land!</p>

<p>Here, upon the table of rock, in full view of one of the
grandest and most eloquent natural panoramas it is possible
for the mind of man to conceive, Leonard and Templemore
stood the morning following the former&rsquo;s interview with
Monella, looking out upon the scene. A high wind, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
bracing and exhilarating freshness, blew in their faces,
rushed with a roar through the branches above them,
swaying the great trees to and fro, and then, seeming to
tear off across the valley at one leap, continued its wild
course amongst the trees on the heights that lined the
further side. Leonard, on turning to look across the lake,
saw Ergalon advancing up the slope and making signs to
him. He drew Jack&rsquo;s attention to the signals, and they
both descended the terraces of rock below to meet him.
Here all was quiet; they were sheltered from the gusts
of wind; the roar of the gale no longer met their
ears.</p>

<p>All the time they had been in the city they had had a
guard. It consisted of a file of soldiers with an officer,
and they followed the two young men in all their walks,
movements, journeys, never thrusting themselves on their
attention, yet always ready to assist and defend them, if
occasion should arise. Monella, also, had an escort whenever
he went out. He had particularly enjoined on the other
two never to stir abroad without their rifles, and this injunction,
though they did not always see its necessity, they
implicitly observed.</p>

<p>They had not seen much of Ergalon of late; he had
attached himself more particularly to Monella, and had, in
fact, become his particular attendant. Monella had trusted
him so far as to explain to him something of the secrets of
the firearms, and had instructed him in the loading of them
in case circumstances should arise in which his assistance
might be needed. Accordingly, when Leonard saw him
coming up the hillside and signifying that he wished to
speak to them, he at once called Templemore and left the
ledge where they had been standing.</p>

<p>Soon they saw their guard approaching with Ergalon in
advance of them, and, following them, Monella, who came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
on leisurely from ledge to ledge, occasionally giving a
glance behind him.</p>

<p>The hillside was marked out in terraces, or tables of
rock, most of them covered with greensward and fringed
at the sides with belts of trees. Ergalon, who had taken
his stand below, made signs to the two to come down to
him, and, when they had descended within hearing, he
addressed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lord Monella has sent me to warn you to await
him here and to be ready for a contest. There is trouble
afoot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why wait here?&rdquo; asked Jack. &ldquo;We will go down
to him at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ergalon shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He particularly desired that you
would await him here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So be it; if you are sure you rightly understood him.
But tell us, friend Ergalon, what all this means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ergalon explained that Coryon had unexpectedly dispatched
a large force of his soldiers to capture the three
strangers. They had hoped to surprise them without
giving time for others of the king&rsquo;s soldiers to lend their
aid. But he (Ergalon) had, through a former comrade
who was still one of Coryon&rsquo;s people, attained intimation
of the intended movement, and had been able thus to
warn Monella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the lord Monella,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;sent on your
guard in advance, and then himself walked up the hill
towards you that they might see him. Thus he hoped to
draw Coryon&rsquo;s people away from the palace and the
houses to this place, where, he says, it will be better to
make a stand and fight them, since thus no other persons
will be injured in the encounter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was strange, but all who spoke of Monella, or to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
gave him some title of honour or respect. Ergalon called
him &lsquo;lord.&rsquo; Even Dakla, at the meeting in the king&rsquo;s
council chamber&mdash;spite of his insolent swagger towards
the king&mdash;had been awed by this man&rsquo;s look into addressing
him by the equivalent in their language of &lsquo;sir.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many are there of them?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a hundred&mdash;or perhaps more. But the lord
Monella has said their number matters not; and he sent
me to the king to beg that none of his soldiers should
interfere. &lsquo;They would only be in the way,&rsquo; he said.
He sent these extra things for you. See.&rdquo; And he showed
a parcel of cartridges he had brought with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;He is quite right. That&rsquo;s all we
wanted; we can answer for the rest. More soldiers
would only be in the way; and some of them would be
pretty sure to get hurt, if not killed outright&mdash;and all for
nothing. I think I see Monella&rsquo;s idea. It is&rdquo;&mdash;turning
to Elwood&mdash;&ldquo;to take up our position here and shoot them
down as they come across this wide terrace just below us.
Not a man of them will ever cross that stretch alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are your guards,&rdquo; observed Ergalon. &ldquo;The lord
Monella desired that you should place them somewhere
where they would be out of the way, but within call.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them get on to this next ledge, then, just behind
us. There they will have a fine view of everything. Did
these people think to surprise us, do you think, friend
Ergalon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt. Your habit of coming here of a morning
has been noted, I suspect, and they had intended, I
imagine, to creep round and get up through the woods
unseen. But the lord Monella, being warned by me,
went up on a high rock, where he could see them in the
distance; when they saw they were observed by him, they
gave up that plan and came straight on.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. Well, we owe you something for having
warned us, friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; Ergalon answered simply. &ldquo;My life
was forfeited that day, and you spared me; and through
the lord Monella and the princess, I gained the king&rsquo;s
pardon. I owe you all my service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the guards and their officer had arrived,
and were placed by Ergalon on a terrace above and
behind that on which the two were standing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We like it not, this mode of yours&mdash;putting us in
the background, out of danger, while you stand up in
front,&rdquo; observed the officer; &ldquo;we consent only because
the lord Monella so desires it. They are many, but we
should not shrink; and others from the king&rsquo;s palace
would soon come to our assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, good Abla. We have no misgivings of
your courage. But you could do no good with so few
men&mdash;they are more than ten to one, I hear&mdash;and your
men would but impede us. Besides, it will give them a
lesson for the future, if we deal with them ourselves,
unaided.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abla bowed and walked away unwillingly, as one
who is bound to obey orders, but does so against his
will.</p>

<p>Monella now came in view, and was soon standing by
their side. After a few words of explanation, he said
gravely,</p>

<p>&ldquo;They thought to have surprised us all three up
here; but, when they saw they had failed in that, they
took a bold course and came straight on. Now that
means, in effect, an open challenge to the king. It
means,&rdquo; he continued with increased earnestness, &ldquo;civil
war. Civil war, you understand, has therefore broken
out in the land&mdash;unless we nip it in the bud, <em>here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
now</em>, as we can, if we show no untimely hesitation.
These men are scoundrels of the serpent&rsquo;s brood; cruel,
bloodthirsty tools of the human fiends behind them.
They deserve no mercy, no consideration. Let none be
shown to them! My plan is simply to shoot them down
the instant they appear on that ledge below us. They
<em>must</em> climb up in front; there is no way round it, nor
any means of getting to the height above us. Therefore,
they must cross that piece of open ground. One word
more. The chief, Dakla, leads them. Do not fire at
him. I wish to take him alive, if possible; he will make
our best ambassador hereafter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under such conditions the battle could not be a long
one. Monella had chosen his ground skilfully, so as
to make the utmost of the advantage firearms gave him.
The black-coated myrmidons of Coryon scaled the fatal
terrace only to be shot down the moment that they
came in sight. There were only four or five places where
they could climb up and, at these, not more than two
men could pass together. Those who reached the top and
escaped a bullet, turned back when they heard the
explosions of the firearms, saw the flashes and the smoke,
saw also their comrades fall. Others of those below who
could see nothing of what was going on, swarmed up in
their places, only to fall or turn back at once in like
manner; till, in a short time, every man had been up
and witnessed the ghastly sight of the dead and wounded
lying around, and had satisfied himself that not one could
cross that level piece of rock to come near their foes.
Finally, the survivors were all seized with panic when
one of the last to show his head above the ridge came
back crying out that &ldquo;the white demons were coming
down after them.&rdquo; At this, all those who were unhurt
turned and fled. But many had fallen, dead or wounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and lay at the foot of the rock they had climbed up only
to be instantly shot down. Above, on the terrace itself,
but at one side, stood Dakla and one of his subordinates.
These had been amongst the first to appear above the
ledge, and had moved aside to let the men form into line
up on the rock; but now they were left alone, and, when
Monella quietly descended from the rock above, they had
the mortification of seeing all their men who were capable
of running disappear in frantic terror down the hillside.</p>

<p>Then he who stood by Dakla made a rush at Monella
with uplifted sword, thinking, since he seemed to be
unarmed, that he would fall an easy prey; but the man
fell with a pistol ball in his breast ere he had gone
half way to meet Monella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now yield, Dakla,&rdquo; Monella called to the other. &ldquo;It
is useless either to fight or run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will see to that,&rdquo; Dakla exclaimed savagely. &ldquo;If
thou be man, and not demon, this sword shall find thine
heart.&rdquo; And he too made a sudden rush. But, before
he had gone three yards, the sword flew from his hand
and his arm dropped useless by his side. Monella had
shot him in the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou see&rsquo;st,&rdquo; he said coldly, as he now approached
the crestfallen chief, &ldquo;how ill-advised thou hast been not
to give heed to all my warnings. I could have slain thee
earlier in the fight; I could have killed thee now, as I
did thy friend there; but I have spared thy life. It is
not for thine own sake, but that thou mayest bear a
message to thy master, and witness to him of that which
thou hast seen and warn him once more of the futility
of warring against us, the allies of the king. Dost thou
understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other cast a murderous scowl upon Monella, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
made no answer for a moment. Then, after reflection,
he said in a dogged, surly tone,</p>

<p>&ldquo;So be it. But thou must give thy message quickly
and let me go; for thou hast hurt me sore and the blood
flows fast&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will see to thy wound,&rdquo; Monella replied composedly.
&ldquo;Let me bind it up till we get to the king&rsquo;s
palace; there it shall be seen to farther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Dakla, reluctantly, and with an ill grace, submitted
to have his wound bound up by his enemy, who, before
commencing, took away the other&rsquo;s dagger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot trust thee with these playthings,&rdquo; he observed.
&ldquo;Thou art of the wolf tribe, Dakla.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the officer and men of their guard had come
down to the lower terrace, with Templemore and Elwood,
and were looking in awe and horror upon the outcome of
the fight&mdash;if so one-sided an encounter could be so called.
On Monella and the two young men they gazed in
wonder; and, gradually, they drew away from them in
fear, from that moment treating them with even greater
deference than before.</p>

<p>Monella despatched Abla to summon more soldiers from
the king&rsquo;s palace to bring down the dead and wounded;
and himself set about attending to the latter, first handing
Dakla over to Templemore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look you!&rdquo; said Jack to his prisoner, &ldquo;if you attempt
to escape, I shall not kill you, but hurt your other arm;
and, if that does not stop you, I shall hurt your leg, and
I know that that <em>will</em>. Do you follow me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dakla nodded a sour assent; then stood looking with
evident surprise at the trouble Monella was now taking
with some of his late enemies. Such singular behaviour
he did not understand, and he shrugged his shoulders in
contempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>When, after a time, more soldiers, with some officers,
arrived upon the scene, these were at once set to work to
bear the dead and wounded down the hill. Monella
followed with his friends and Dakla. The noise of the
firing had brought out great crowds of people, who were
now massed about the palace waiting to receive them.
They had watched the precipitate flight of the survivors
of the soldiers of Coryon, and rejoiced greatly at their
defeat. But, when they saw the dead and wounded, and
that Dakla was himself a prisoner, and heard that not one
had been hurt upon the other side, their astonishment
was complete.</p>

<p>The king himself, with some of his ministers and
officials, came out to meet the victors; and his gratitude
and emotion, when he noted all these things and greeted
Monella and his friends, were profuse and heartfelt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye have indeed rendered us a service,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;and taught Coryon a lesson he will do well to take to
heart. I feared me greatly that harm would come to ye,
and that war would follow in the land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, we have laid the dogs of war, I trust, at any
rate, for the present,&rdquo; Monella returned, with a grave
smile. &ldquo;They will not attack us further, I opine, nor
brave thee in the future in this rebellious fashion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they entered the palace, and Ulama came forward
to welcome them, with Zonella and many more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have been in such trouble about you,&rdquo; she said,
the tears standing in her tender eyes, &ldquo;ever since they
told us that over a hundred of Coryon&rsquo;s people had gone
up the rocks to take you. And we heard the noise of the
thunder-wands, and were in great fear, till they told us
that your enemies were fleeing. Then we looked out
and saw them rushing madly down the hill, throwing
away their spears, and their helmets, and even fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
one another in their haste to scramble down the rocks.
Then Abla came and told us you were all safe, and
then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Zonella, &ldquo;you sat down and wept.&rdquo;
And at that Ulama laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear it is true,&rdquo; she said.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<span class="f8">THE LEGEND OF MELLENDA.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Monella&rsquo;s</span> anticipations of what would follow the
severe lesson they had given Coryon&rsquo;s followers
turned out to be well founded. For when Dakla, with
his arm in a sling, revisited his master, bearing a message
from the king, the conditions offered were accepted.</p>

<p>Dakla had been straightly charged that these terms
would have to be submitted to; if not that his master and
all his followers would be starved into submission. They
would be confined to their own colony, supplies of food
refused, and any of their number leaving their retreat
would be killed at sight.</p>

<p>The conditions imposed were that not merely the three
strangers, but all the &lsquo;lay&rsquo; inhabitants were to be free
from molestation by Coryon&rsquo;s people; and that no more
&lsquo;blood-tax&rsquo; was to be levied.</p>

<p>After many journeys to and fro, and much delay, Dakla
at last announced that Coryon agreed to the conditions
for a time&mdash;for four months. After that, their great
festival would be coming on, and&mdash;well, time would show.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is only a truce,&rdquo; said Monella, with a sigh, to his
two young friends. &ldquo;I would it had been permanent; but
it will give us time, and the opportunity of shaping out
our course. The people will have a respite from the
terrible fear that now is ever with them; and, short of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
engaging in a protracted civil conflict, for which the
people are not yet prepared, I see not what better could
have been arranged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were thus now able to move about more freely,
and without a guard; their rifles, too, could be left behind
when they went abroad; though Monella had counselled
that they should always carry their revolvers; for he
feared they were not altogether safe from treachery, or
from some fanatical outbreak on the part of certain of the
priests&rsquo; adherents.</p>

<p>Thus Templemore and Elwood were now able to mingle
more freely with the populace and to see more of their
social life. And, wherever they went, they were well
received, and treated with both confidence and respect.
They visited the houses of people of all classes, from the
palaces of the nobles to the dwellings of the peasantry, if
so the lower classes might be called. There were, however,
no poor in the country, in the ordinary sense of the
word. The crops grown were supplied to all alike;
every one had plenty to eat, and plenty of clothes to wear,
and well-built houses to live in. And, beyond these
requisites, there was little in the land to pine for. There
were forests, and from these all were free to cut wood for
fuel; the electric light was laid on to all alike. The
water they required they supplied themselves with from
the lake, or from one or other of the streams that everywhere
gushed forth from the rocks above. Of shops there
were none; but there was a market-place, and a sort of
market or exchange was held there once a week. Even
this, however, was falling into disuse. There was a
currency; and there were many kinds of coins; but they
were seldom used. They were of ancient make and
were preserved rather as curiosities, seemingly, than for
use. There was so little that the people wanted, either to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
buy or sell, that a simple system of barter sufficed for
practically all their needs.</p>

<p>Elwood and Templemore, as they came to know all
these things, and gained experience of the simple good-nature
of the people, felt increased indignation and
resentment against the priests. They saw that the horrible
tyranny of these men had turned a land that might have
been a realm of perfect peace and goodwill, into one where
constant dread and hopeless misery and suffering had
become so common, that all seemed helplessly resigned
to it.</p>

<p>One day, when the two were in a boat with Ulama and
Zonella, Kalaima, and others, Templemore, who had been
talking of these matters, asked whether the state of things
they had seen had been of long duration.</p>

<p>The reply came from Zonella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever since the time of the great Mellenda. So we are
told. It is the punishment sent by the Great Spirit upon
the people for their ingratitude to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who was Mellenda?&rdquo; asked Elwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! You ask who was Mellenda? But I forgot;
of course, you have not been here very long, and cannot
know our history and legends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been prying about more in your museums than
has my friend,&rdquo; Jack observed, &ldquo;and I have learned
something of Mellenda. But I know nothing of any
legend. Pray let us hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, tell us about it,&rdquo; Leonard urged. &ldquo;I like fine
old legends and tales of wonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask the princess to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Zonella,&rdquo; Ulama interposed. &ldquo;You began it;
you finish it. Besides, you are more learned in such
things than I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Zonella said resignedly. &ldquo;I can only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
give it as I know it. If you want further details, you
must go to the museum, or ask Colenna, the High
Chamberlain, who is a very learned man. Only I do not
wish you to ridicule it&rdquo;&mdash;this to the two young men&mdash;&ldquo;for,
though I call it a legend, yet it is history; and all
our people implicitly believe it. You could not offend
them more than by treating it lightly or affecting to disbelieve
it. I give <em>you</em> that as a caution, more particularly,&rdquo;
she added, looking mischievously at Jack, &ldquo;for I know
that you are very much inclined to scepticism in such
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will promise to be very good, and to make no
frivolous remarks,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s laughing answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you must know,&rdquo; Zonella began, &ldquo;that we deem
Mellenda the greatest of our kings; that is, of our later
kings. Our ancient line of kings before him had made
Manoa the greatest, the most powerful, and the richest
country of the world. These mountains that you have
seen around us were all islands in a great lake&mdash;the lake
of Parima. Its waters extended to the great mountains
that we can sometimes see from the highest points about
Manoa&mdash;far, far away. But over those, and over lands in
every direction, our nation held sway. These islands
were our chief fastnesses, and this one, Manoa, being the
highest and the most naturally favoured of them all, was
the seat of government, and its city was the capital to
which were brought all the wealth and the most valued
productions of the other countries that formed part of its
empire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, after many mighty kings had lived and died,
a weakness seemed to fall upon the people. They were
defeated in battle; provinces revolted, and many distant
parts of the empire were lost, passing under other
kings. At that time, it is said, our kings and nobles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
chiefs among the nation were too much given to feasting
and enjoyment; and, it is declared, they began cruelly to
oppress the weaker of the people. And a change came
over the religion. Up to then all had worshipped only
one Great Spirit, who was said to be a good Spirit&mdash;the
great ruler of all spirits, in fact, and his priests were
called &lsquo;Children of the Light.&rsquo; Their rule&mdash;what they
taught&mdash;was gentle; it is recorded that they were men of
peace and of great&mdash;very, very great&mdash;wisdom. But
another religion had been introduced, coming, it is believed,
from some of the lands that had been conquered; and
this was the exact opposite of the old one. Its votaries
and high priests called themselves &lsquo;Children of the
Night&rsquo;; they worshipped, not one God, but many strange
and terrible gods; their priests, also, were thought to
possess great wisdom, but of an evil kind. They taught
that there was but one way to escape the power of the
Spirits of Darkness, and that was by propitiating them by
constant sacrifices; and they killed many people at their
festivals to give them to their gods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Mellenda came to the throne. He was the only
son of the last of the ancient line of kings. While young
he had travelled far and gained much knowledge in
strange countries; and he had already, as general of
some of his father&rsquo;s armies, defeated the enemies of the
country, and regained some of the lost provinces. His
father was killed in battle, and Mellenda immediately set
about plans for reviving the old power and recovering the
former empire of the nation. He taught, too, that the
White religion was the true religion, and he made
endeavours to put down the other. But he was absent
for long periods at a time, upon distant expeditions, from
which, it is true, he always returned victorious; but,
while he was away, establishing peace and order in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
distant province, the Dark Priests were craftily at work
undermining his authority at home. However, for a long
time, nothing came of their plottings, and Mellenda reigned
for several hundred years&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a long time,&rdquo; Jack interrupted, regardless of
his promise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For several hundred years,&rdquo; repeated Zonella with a
reproving look at the interrupter, &ldquo;which was not very
long, considering that his father had reigned for fifteen
hundred years, and was then cut off, in the flower of his
age, by an accident in battle. He (Mellenda) had restored
peace at last throughout the whole empire; reformed the
style of living, himself setting an example of great
simplicity; and his wisdom and justice and kindness of
heart had made him revered and loved wherever the name
of Manoa was known. Then, finally, he married a princess
he was passionately fond of, named Elmonta, and had
four children, upon whom, they say, he lavished the most
tender love. But some occasion arose for him to leave
Manoa once more, to visit a distant part of his great
empire. There was a treaty of alliance to be made with
another monarch, or some such matter of importance.
He sailed away and returned after a long absence, to find
that Coryon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coryon!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, once more forgetful of his
promises.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Coryon, the same Coryon, as is believed, that
we have here in the land to-day. He had seized
upon the government and gained over a vast number of
the most dissolute and discontented spirits to his side.
He was then, as now, the chief of the Dark Brotherhood,
or Children of the Night. All the crowd of idle,
self-indulgent nobles and men of wealth, but of loose life,
among the people, whom Mellenda had rebuked and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
curbed, broke out and joined Coryon&rsquo;s revolt; and they
actually seized upon Elmonta, Mellenda&rsquo;s queen, and his
children, and offered them as sacrifices to their gods.
Coryon set up a king of his own choosing; and, when
Mellenda returned, he found his wife and children dead,
and the government in the hands of a puppet king
controlled by Coryon, who threatened him with death if
he landed and fell into his hands. Such was the message
sent out to Mellenda when he arrived in sight of our
island on his return, successful in the mission that had
called him away, and impatient to get back to his wife and
children. He had with him a great fleet of vessels; and,
though the revolt had spread to the other islands, he
could, perhaps, have found followers enough in other
parts of the empire to have regained his throne, had he
been so minded. But he was broken-hearted, and said
that, since his wife and children were no longer living, he
had nothing left to fight for, and cared not to take part
in a civil war with his own people. Instead, he decreed
that their punishment should be that he (Mellenda)
would go away and leave them for many ages to suffer
under the lash of the foul religion they had supported;
till all who had sinned against him saw their wicked
error, when he would return to punish finally the Dark
Priests and those who still wilfully supported them.
Then, and for ever afterwards, there should be peace
and happiness and justice throughout the land for all
his people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Mellenda sailed away, and was never seen or
heard of more. Not long after his departure came the
great sinking of the waters, and the lake of Parima
disappeared. This the better-disposed inhabitants left
here regarded as a special punishment for their allowing
Coryon to usurp the government and drive away the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
great, good, and wise Mellenda. And they rose up
against Coryon and the king he had set up. But
the crafty priest had obtained too strong a position
for the movement to succeed. Moreover, he managed to
pacify a part of his opponents in a strange way. He
declared he had not put to death all Mellenda&rsquo;s children,
and produced a boy, who, it is said, was recognised by
those who ought to know as one of Mellenda&rsquo;s children.
This child he promised to place upon the throne; and
afterwards he did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nation, shut off from all the world, has much
decreased in numbers, and is now unknown where it
was once all-powerful. For centuries, it is said, the
surrounding country was but a chaos of swamp and
mud. By degrees there grew up vegetation, and finally
trees that, in time, became thick, tangled forests that
could not be penetrated. Thus, for long ages, we have
been cut off from all the other peoples of the world.
Some parties were sent out, hundreds of years ago, to
explore the surrounding country; but some never returned,
and those who did brought back such terrible accounts
of awful woods haunted by fearful creatures, and of
deserts beyond, inhabited only by black demons, that
it was considered better to keep the country here entirely
to ourselves. So I believe the only known way
that led out into the woods was sealed up for good;
and thus ended the last attempt to communicate with the
outside world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many of the White Priests fled to Mellenda&rsquo;s vessels,
and were taken away with him when he departed; but
the others, including their chief, Sanaima, retired to
Myrlanda, where they have ever since maintained themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the story of Mellenda, and of how he left us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and of what befell the proud city of Manoa after his
departure. When he will come back we know not; but
some old prophecies obtain amongst the people according
to which the time of his return is very near, if it is not
indeed overpast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His return!&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;You surely would not
have us understand that you expect this venerable old
fossil to return, in the flesh, to trouble himself about
the present state of the descendants of his ungrateful
people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zonella stared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, <em>of course</em> we do!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;There is
not a man or a woman&mdash;scarcely a child of a few years old&mdash;that
has not been taught to believe in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; Ulama exclaimed, almost indignantly.
&ldquo;We all <em>know</em> it will be so; we believe it
absolutely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;how long ago do you reckon all
this took place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About two thousand years,&rdquo; Zonella replied, after a
brief, but apparently careful, calculation, counting up on
her fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two thousand years! And you&mdash;you two sensible
young people&mdash;tell us you expect to see this badly-treated,
but respectable, old gentleman turn up again, just much
as usual, I suppose, after two thousand years!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Ulama asked. &ldquo;We have Coryon and
Sanaima, both said to be older than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but&rdquo;&mdash;looking at Leonard&mdash;&ldquo;I fancy that is
like the Pharoahs of old, you know, where there was
always a Pharoah on the throne, though kings were born
and died. It would be easy to keep up a farce of that
sort where, as here, the &lsquo;High Priest,&rsquo; black or white, is
so seldom visible&mdash;always in the background.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But if the king is three hundred and forty, may it
not be possible to live to two thousand, or more? I can
point out many men of more than five hundred in the king&rsquo;s
palace,&rdquo; observed Zonella.</p>

<p>The gentle Ulama, even, looked somewhat offended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not question the wonderful things you tell us
about the world outside,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why should you
question what we know to be true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Leonard, &ldquo;that it all depends
upon the virtues of the &lsquo;Plant of Life.&rsquo; Now, if that herb,
or plant, or whatever it is, really has the qualities attributed
to it, why, the rest is easy enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I admit that,&rdquo; Jack said, laughing. &ldquo;When once that
is conceded, a man may just as easily live to five thousand
years. Only, even in that case, I see a difficulty. How
would Mellenda get the necessary &lsquo;Plant of Life&rsquo; away
from here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The White Priests who went away with him would not
be likely to leave their secret behind,&rdquo; explained Zonella.
&ldquo;Besides, it is specially stated in our historical manuscripts&mdash;so
Colenna has told me&mdash;that those who went out from
the island for long periods&mdash;governors of distant provinces
and the like&mdash;not only took a large supply of the dried
plant with them, but seeds that they might grow it; and
in some places they found the plant do well; though they
kept its virtues a secret from the peoples they went amongst.
These things would be known to Mellenda and to the
White Priests who went away with him; and, probably,
they settled in a place where they knew the plant was
being grown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were that so, it would explain something of the former
far-reaching fame and power of a small nation of islanders
like these,&rdquo; said Leonard. &ldquo;The secret of such a plant&mdash;the
rapid increase of population when there were so few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
deaths in proportion&mdash;would of course give them a long
pull over other nations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to the question whether we seriously expect
Mellenda to return to us,&rdquo; resumed Zonella, &ldquo;in the large
museum you will see one of his suits of armour, his banner,
and a celebrated sword of his, all kept bright and ready
for use and well preserved. They are kept there waiting
for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw them,&rdquo; Jack remarked. &ldquo;He must have been
a big fine man, if that suit fitted him. But, to go back to
the son of this great king, said to have been saved after
all, and then put on the throne; did he have any
descendants?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zonella nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There have been five kings in the direct line since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. So that the present king is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great-great-great-grandson of the great Mellenda,&rdquo;
put in Ulama.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it was rather fortunate you managed as you
did when you came here,&rdquo; Zonella said after a pause; &ldquo;for,
if Coryon had been the first to know of you strangers being
in the country, he would have striven in every way to
have killed or captured you. They say he is a firm believer
in the early coming of Mellenda, and is in mortal
terror about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack was silent awhile, and then he observed drily,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all I can say is that I should very much like
to see the good gentleman, if he is still about; and I only
hope and wish he will arrive while we are here. If he has
been travelling around all these years, by this time he
must know a thing or two! I wonder whether he will
come in a balloon!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<span class="f8">HOPES AND FEARS.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Amongst</span> other advantages of the peace or truce
that had been arranged with the mysterious Coryon,
one was that Elwood and Templemore were free to visit
the canyon and the caves where their reserve stores lay,
and assure themselves that they were all safe. To do
this they had to arrange to be away one night, since it
was a day&rsquo;s journey each way. That night they passed
in the cavern&mdash;which they had named &lsquo;Monella Cave&rsquo;
in honour of their friend; the canyon itself they called
&lsquo;Fairy Valley&rsquo;&mdash;and their camp equipage being all found
intact where they had hidden it away, they had everything
at hand for making themselves comfortable. They found,
on examination, that the stone that closed the entrance
was in the same position as when they had left it.
Having removed the wooden bars, they rolled it to one
side, and looked out into the gloomy depths of Roraima
Forest.</p>

<p>From this outlook Templemore turned back with a
shudder of disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I hate that forest!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;How
miserable it seems out there! Verily it is wonderful, if
you come to think of it, that we ever had the patience
and perseverance to cut our way through to this place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We never should have done so, but for Monella&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
influence,&rdquo; observed Leonard. &ldquo;How strange it all seems,
doesn&rsquo;t it? Now that we are back here, we could almost
think all we have been through a dream. One thing is
certain; no other party of explorers would ever work
their way through this wood as we did; they would get
disheartened before the end of the first week. Nor could
they possibly do any good by persevering, unless they
had that to guide them which Monella had. What is that
piece of white over there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Leonard indicated a white patch upon a tree-trunk
at the edge of the clearing.</p>

<p>Templemore took out his glasses and looked through
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a piece of paper,&rdquo; he cried excitedly. &ldquo;Some one&rsquo;s
been here! We must go out and inquire into this!&rdquo;
The ladder was quickly got out, and they hurried down it
and across the clearing to the tree that bore the unexpected
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">affiche</i>. But, though the paper must have been purposely
nailed in its place it was blank; on opening it, however,
they found a few straight lines that formed a somewhat
vague resemblance to the letter M.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matava has been here!&rdquo; Leonard cried out. &ldquo;All
he can do in the writing line is to make some marks that
mean M&mdash;his own initial, you know. Poor fellow!
Fancy his venturing here to seek for us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The paper had been folded many times, the &lsquo;M&rsquo; being
in the inside; and it had been nailed just under an
overhanging piece of bark, as a protection from the
weather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have executed this elaborate piece of penmanship
at &lsquo;Monella Lodge&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;and brought it
with him in case his journey here should be in vain. He&rsquo;s
a good fellow! Knowing, as we do, how he and all his
tribe abhor this wood and the mountain, we can appreciate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the devotion that led him to screw up his courage so far.
And then to have come for nothing! It&rsquo;s too bad, poor
chap! What a pity we could not have got down here
and seen him! Plainly he had some hope we might
return, or he would not have left this simple yet ingeniously
contrived message for us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His hope would be but a faint one at best,&rdquo; Leonard
replied gravely. &ldquo;Having been here and found the
entrance fast closed, and after our failing to make any
signals, as arranged, I fear he will carry back an alarming
tale to Georgetown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear so too, Leonard,&rdquo; Jack assented very seriously.
&ldquo;They will be terribly alarmed about us; worse than if
he had gone straight back without coming here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That evening, after they had cooked their evening meal,
they sat by the smouldering fire, both silent and both
thoughtful. Jack smoked away moodily at his pipe;
Leonard was absolutely idle, except that he turned his
eyes, now on the glow of failing daylight overhead, then
down at the scene around him.</p>

<p>Each knew what was in the other&rsquo;s mind; yet neither
liked to be the first to speak of it. But at last Jack
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use blinking the fact, Leonard,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;that this visit of Matava here and the account he is sure
to carry back is a serious matter. Our friends will be
more than alarmed; they will, perhaps, give us up for
dead. This raises the whole question again, What are we
going to do here, how long are we going to stay, and
what about getting back? We can&rsquo;t stay here for ever&mdash;at
least, <em>I</em> certainly don&rsquo;t mean to. I don&rsquo;t like the idea
of going away and leaving you here. Where are we
drifting to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard was gloomy. He had been so more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
ever since that conversation with Monella about Ulama.
For a few minutes he made no reply; then said, with a
tinge of bitterness in his tone,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must wait awhile, Jack. I am not prepared to
say yet, but&mdash;it may be I shall be ready to clear out soon
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack raised his eyebrows and gave a brief, but keen,
glance at his friend. Then he smoked on stolidly for a
while and ruminated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one who will never go back with us,&rdquo; presently
he went on, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s Monella. He spoke truly when
he said he should never return to &lsquo;civilisation.&rsquo; He
seems to have resolved to make his home here for the
future. He is now the king&rsquo;s right hand&mdash;his &lsquo;guide,
counsellor, and friend,&rsquo; with him constantly, except when
he&rsquo;s away in the place they call Myrlanda, on some
mysterious business. And, perhaps, the oddest thing
of all is that he is the most popular man at the court&mdash;even
with those he has, in a sense, displaced. You would
think there would be all kinds of envy, and hatred,
and jealousy, and counter-plotting, and general &lsquo;ructions,&rsquo;
when a stranger, suddenly come from goodness knows
where, stepped upon the scene and became straight away
the favourite and confidant and counsellor of the king!
Yet, the more he takes that character upon himself, the
more they all seem to like him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can help liking him?&rdquo; Leonard sighed. &ldquo;Who
can help loving him? Even where he reproves, he
does it so tenderly you only love him the more for it.
How can any one feel jealous, or angry, or envious
with a man who behaves to all as he does? For myself
I do not wonder; he was born to be a leader of men, as
I said long ago; he has that magnetic attraction that
makes a great commander&mdash;a commander who inspires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
such devotion that thousands and hundreds of thousands
are ready to give their lives for but a glance of approval
or a word of praise. There can&rsquo;t be many such men
at this moment in the world; there cannot have been
many since the world was made. But, when such a
man appears, he quickly spreads his influence around
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack gave a little laugh; but not an ill-natured one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are as full as ever of enthusiasm for your
hero,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;though he <em>has</em> been a sort of cold
shower-bath to you lately, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard coloured, and shifted uneasily on his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guessed it, old man. In fact, I saw the &lsquo;cold
shower-bath&rsquo; in his eye that day&mdash;you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;perhaps you are not far out, Jack. However,
I promised to leave things in his hands, and there
they must remain at present. Of his regard for me I
have no doubt whatever&mdash;or for us both. If he cannot
do the almost impossible, I shall accept my fate, and
try to bear it as well as may be. Let us say no more
about it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack, who for all his usual habit of appearing somewhat
unobservant, could see most things, thought he could have
told his friend of some one else who was displaying signs
of unhappiness under Monella&rsquo;s &lsquo;cold shower-bath&rsquo; treatment&mdash;Ulama,
to wit. She had become very quiet and
grave of late; and, indeed, the fresh, childish gaiety
she had shown during the first few days after their
arrival had disappeared. But Jack discreetly decided to
keep these thoughts to himself, and let events take their
course. He knew that they were in the keeping of a
head wiser and more far-seeing than his own&mdash;Monella&rsquo;s.
Of late they had seen comparatively little of him; he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
most of his time either closeted with the king, or had gone,
it was said, to Myrlanda, to visit Sanaima, the chief of the
&lsquo;White Priests.&rsquo; On these occasions he would be away
for two or three days together. Yet, whenever either of
the young men chanced to run against him&mdash;or, if they
met at the king&rsquo;s table&mdash;they found no alteration in his
manner. Indeed, he showed, if anything, increased kindliness
in both his words and actions, often going out of
his way to do some little thing, in a manner all his own,
to show, before whoever might be present, his cordial
feelings towards them. For the rest, he had the air of
one whose mind is charged with anxious and weighty
thoughts, and both Templemore and Elwood <em>felt</em> rather
than knew that he was occupied with fears of trouble in
the future.</p>

<p>One morning, a few days after the visit to the canyon,
Monella invited Leonard to walk out with him, and they
went together to the place they had named &lsquo;Monella&rsquo;s
Height.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The day was clear and bright, and a slight breeze came
sighing through the tree-tops. The scene around was
full of soft repose, soothing and curiously satisfying to
the mind. But Leonard noticed it not to-day; his heart
beat fast, and his colour came and went, for something in
Monella&rsquo;s manner told him that he was about to hear a
statement of moment on the subject that was always
uppermost in his thoughts. He tried to brace himself to
bear the worst, if it must come; but his effort was not
too successful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; Monella presently began, &ldquo;I promised to
speak with you, when I could, upon the matter we talked
about one day. Is your mind still the same concerning
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was it? Did he need to ask? Leonard impulsively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
replied. And he launched into a rhapsody that need not
here be given at length. Monella listened in silence till
the young man had finished, and then went on,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you considered whether your wish is a wise&mdash;a
final one? That, were it granted, you must remain
here for good? Never to return to your own people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, never?&rdquo; Leonard asked. &ldquo;In the future&mdash;one
day, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must clearly understand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that that
cannot be. I have told you all along that I never expected
to return from my journey here; and now I know
that I shall never leave this place. And you and your
friend&mdash;you will have ere long to decide either to stay
here for good, or leave for good. If you elect to go, the
king will send you away rich&mdash;so rich that you will no
more need to strive for wealth; if to stay, he will give
you posts of honour where you can profitably employ
yourselves in helping me in the great task I have set
myself&mdash;the teaching of the true religion of the one great
God to these my people; for&rdquo;&mdash;he continued, when
Leonard looked up at him in surprise&mdash;&ldquo;it is true that I am
one of this nation by descent, and that I have, therefore,
&lsquo;after many days,&rsquo; only wandered back to mine own people.
But I have seen too much of the world outside to love it;
my people desire to keep to themselves, and I can only,
from what I have seen and experienced, confirm them in
that wish. I cannot find it in my conscience to do otherwise.
Therefore, we are resolved that there shall be no
intercourse between us and the great world beyond. It
is useless to say more upon the subject; it is settled
beyond all reach of argument or discussion. Hence, it
will be necessary for both you and your friend to decide
whether to remain and cast in your lot with us for your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
whole future lives, or to say farewell and return&mdash;but not
empty-handed&mdash;to your own people. It is a serious and
weighty matter for you to decide; therefore should not be
settled hastily. Nor is there any need for haste; take as
long as you please to think it over. Wait awhile, till you
have seen more of the place, and have come to know the
people better. Or wait until&rdquo;&mdash;here the speaker&rsquo;s voice
became impressive well-nigh to sternness&mdash;&ldquo;until I shall
have stamped out this serpent brood that hath too long
held this fair land in its loathsome coils. Then shall ye
see a new era here&mdash;an era of peace, and cheerfulness,
and godliness&mdash;and ye shall see that it is good to dwell in
such a country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not believe that any amount of reflection can
alter my wishes in this matter,&rdquo; Leonard answered
earnestly. &ldquo;Painful as the thought of never seeing my
friends again would be, yet it would be still harder to
leave here and never look again on her my heart has
chosen for its queen&mdash;aye, for years before I saw her.
No! Now that fate has led me to her, nothing in this
world shall part us&mdash;if the decision rests with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella regarded the young man fixedly, and there
were both affection and admiration in his glance. Very
handsome Leonard looked, with the light in his open
honest eyes, and the flush upon his cheek. Then
Monella&rsquo;s look waxed overcast as from a passing shadow,
and he made answer, with a sigh,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Youth, with its hopes and aspirations, when they
come from honest promptings, is always fair to look
upon; more&rsquo;s the pity that these aspirations all lead to
but one end&mdash;sorrow, and disappointment, and weariness.
Verily, all is vanity, vanity! We travel by different
roads, but we all arrive at the same goal.&rdquo; He looked
dreamily away across the landscape to the far distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
horizon; then continued, as though talking to himself:
&ldquo;Yet youth pleases, because it desires to live in love&mdash;and
love is God and Heaven in one. It is the principal
of the only two things&mdash;it and memory&mdash;we carry with
us in our passage from this life to the next. Love and
memory are two great indestructible attributes of the
human soul. True, we take with us our &lsquo;character,&rsquo;
as it may be called, but that counts little, unless it
be founded upon love. And memory is the ever-living
witness showing forth whether our life here has been
influenced mainly by selfishness, or ambition, or hate, or
cruelty, or&mdash;love. For only the love shall live and
flourish again; all the rest shall wither and die. Ye
hear of &lsquo;undying hate,&rsquo; but there is no such thing. All
hates, even, die out at last; love only lives for ever and
can never die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused, and remained for a space gazing into the
distance. Finally, he turned again to Leonard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come with me, and find your friend; I have that to
show you that I wish you seriously to consider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They walked together down the hill. Meanwhile he
continued,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say your mind is made up, if the decision rests
with you. Well, nominally, it rests with the king, of
course; but, in reality, I suspect, in this case with the
maiden herself. The king is too fond of her&mdash;too anxious
for her happiness&mdash;to desire to thwart her wishes. And
he has remarked of late that she is not as she used to be;
that she has fits of sadness and melancholy. Her state
alarms him. I think, perhaps, he fears it may be the
first sign of what is called here the &lsquo;falloa.&rsquo; But,&rdquo; looking
at Leonard with a half-smile, &ldquo;I suspect there is a
remedy for her disease, whereas there is none known for
the &lsquo;falloa.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>When Leonard heard these words his heart and pulses
bounded, and he felt indeed as though walking upon air.
Nor did he forget what he owed in the matter to his
friend. His breast swelled with gratitude, and he
poured out his thanks with a rush of words that stopped
only when he caught sight of Templemore coming towards
them.</p>

<p>Leonard ran to meet him, and somewhat incoherently
explained what Monella had been saying, while Monella
led the way to his own apartments in the palace.</p>

<p>When they were seated there he went over again most
of what he had impressed on Leonard&mdash;for Jack had
understood but little of Elwood&rsquo;s impetuous talk&mdash;and
added,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I want you to advise your friend and consult
with him, lest he should decide too hastily; and that must
not be. I also must speak further with the king. You
see,&rdquo; he continued gravely, &ldquo;this is a serious thing. The
king&rsquo;s son-in-law will look forward to be king one day;
therefore he must not be lightly chosen. Again, to choose
one of an alien race is no small thing. For myself, I am
free from any worldly prejudices about birth, and &lsquo;family,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;royal blood,&rsquo; and all that vain, foolish cant. And
the king is of the same mind, and wants only to choose
for his child the one who pleases her, provided he is
worthy. For that I have passed my word to him. I
have lived long upon the earth and have consorted with
many men; thus I have learned to judge of character and
disposition. And I have met none to whom I would sooner
trust a daughter of mine own, than to our friend here.
On that point, therefore, I have been able to satisfy the
king; and fate seems to have settled the rest beforehand.
For, incredible as the sceptic may regard it, these two
had met in visions long before they encountered one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
another in the flesh. Thus, in the present, as in the past,
fate points the way, and so it will be in the future. For
no one can escape his destiny. For good or ill, each has
a destiny prepared for him, and that destiny he must
perforce fulfil.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<span class="f8">THE MESSAGE OF APALANO.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> furniture in use in the city of Manoa, in material
and style, was not unlike that found in Japan.
That in the palace was of exquisite design and finish,
much of it inlaid with gold and silver. It was such a
cabinet that Monella now unlocked: he took from it a
parchment roll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the document I gave the king the
first day he received us. Now, of course, it belongs to
him; but I have borrowed it, temporarily, to show you.
It was written by Apalano, the last descendant of those
&lsquo;White Priests&rsquo; who fled this country ages ago with the
king Mellenda. In some of the old parchments in my
possession it is described how those who thus went away
found the empire going everywhere to pieces, and falling a
prey to barbaric hordes of black or red or cruel white
races; and how they eventually took refuge in the secluded
valley high up amongst the peaks of the Andes, of which
I have already spoken to you, and dwelt there through
many centuries. They had brought with them, and
succeeded in cultivating, the &lsquo;Plant of Life,&rsquo; or &lsquo;karina&rsquo;;
but, notwithstanding&mdash;and albeit it made them all long-lived&mdash;the
fatal disease, the &lsquo;falloa,&rsquo; claimed them one after
another, till Apalano and I alone were left. Then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
&lsquo;falloa&rsquo; laid its withering hand upon Apalano also; he
lost his last child, and that affected him very deeply; for,
before he died, he wrote this strange letter which tells all
about myself that I know with certainty; yet hints, as you
will see, at still more to be learned in the future. I will
read it to you:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquo1">
<p class="hd">&ldquo;&lsquo;To Sanaima, the Chief White Priest of Manoa.
Or, if dead, his Descendant or Successor.
Or to the Reigning King of Manoa, Greeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I, Apalano, the last of the descendants of the White
Priests who fled with the great King Mellenda, do commend
to your care the bearer of this letter, he whom
ye will know by the name of Monella. He is, after
myself, the sole survivor of our race outside thy land
of Manoa. Treat him with all courtesy, respect and
confidence, for he is of royal descent, and the unsullied
blood of thine ancient line of kings flows in his veins.
Mark well his counsels, give heed to his warnings, and
observe his rulings; for he comes to restore the true
religion of the Great Spirit, and to bring peace and
happiness to our land. Long years ago he did receive
a grievous injury to the head in combat with a savage
foe. This cast a shadow upon his memory of the past,
so that he knoweth naught of what went before, and his
former life is blank, save for some vague passing glimpses
that, at rare times, come back to him in the guise of
dreams and visions. We could have told him much of
all that went before, but we have refrained;&mdash;first for
that he might not have rightly comprehended what we
had to tell, and next, in mercy; for he hath suffered
much. It was deemed best that the recollections of his
sufferings should sleep until the time for his awakening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
should arrive, when the work for which the Great Spirit
hath appointed him shall lie before him and shall form his
sorrow&rsquo;s antidote and comfort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The memory that hath untimely been suspended&mdash;for
we know that it may not be destroyed&mdash;perchance
may be restored to its full power by such an accident
as wrecked it; but, failing that, there is but one sure
treatment&mdash;namely, to drink of the infusion of the herb
called &lsquo;trenima&rsquo; that groweth in Myrlanda and nowhere
else. Let the stranger Monella, that bringeth this to thee,
drink of &lsquo;trenima&rsquo; in accordance with the rules I have laid
down for him upon another scroll; let him, for some
weeks, take of it sparingly even as I have written; then
more frequently, and lo! all his past life, now hidden,
shall be revealed to him, the sun shall light up the
recesses of his memory, and he shall know himself and
what lies before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And my dying eyes, though unable yet to pierce the
future, still can see that his coming amongst you shall be
in itself a sign of the truth of these my words. When
he shall appear to you I know not; only that it will be
at the time the Great Spirit hath appointed&mdash;not an hour
sooner nor an hour behind that time&mdash;ay, not one minute.
And herein ye shall read a message from the Almighty
Spirit, and ye shall know that Monella&rsquo;s coming at that
special time was marked out by the hand of Destiny.
And ye shall find upon his body marks whose meaning
will be known unto Sanaima, or to him on whom hath
fallen his mantle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With my greeting, I bid ye now farewell&mdash;ye unto
whom this scroll shall be delivered&mdash;my first and last
message to the land of my forefathers, and to those that
now rule there. Through many centuries we, a faithful
few, have kept your memory and our love for you green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
in our hearts; and I and those who have been with me
had hoped, as the appointed time drew near, that the
Great Spirit would have deigned to grant to us to see our
ancient city and our native land. But it was not to be;
all have gone save me and him who brings you this; but
in him I send the blessing that we have preserved and
nursed for you through long years of persecution and
despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If ye would return our love and care for you, I pray
you show them unto him we send. I know that he is
worthy of them; and, further, that in his own breast he
bears for you the sum of all the love we in our own
persons would have shown, had we been spared to greet
ye&mdash;I and those who have preceded me to the land of
the Great Spirit.</p>

<p class="sign">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;&lsquo;Farewell!</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Apalano.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>When Monella had finished reading this strange letter,
he leaned his chin upon his hand and fell into a reverie,
Leonard and Templemore meanwhile looking on in
silence. Presently Monella roused himself, and, with a
deep-drawn sigh, passed his hand across his forehead
with a look of pain. His action was as though he had
half-caught some flitting thought or memory, that had,
after all, eluded him; and that the effort to retain it had
cost him mental pain. After a short interval he said,
with one of his rare smiles and in the musical voice that
captivated every one, so full were they of kindliness,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you know as much about me as I know myself.
I did not show you this before, because I had been
charged to hand it only to those to whom it was addressed;
and this is the first opportunity I have since had, for the
king sent it to Sanaima, who returned it only a day or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
two ago. But, since you must now consider seriously
the question of your going or remaining, it is right that
you should know all I can tell you of myself. It is very
little; yet sufficient to explain my present feelings. You
can understand, now that you have read that letter, that
I am now, with all my heart and soul, one with these
people. I look at everything from their point of view;
I consider only their interest, their welfare, their safety,
their advantage. If you shall elect to remain with us&mdash;to
become one of us&mdash;you shall find me ever a staunch
friend who will do all he can to make you feel at home
amongst us, and will place you in positions of great
honour. If, on the other hand, you prefer to leave us,
you shall not go without such marks of the king&rsquo;s favour
as are beyond, perhaps, your dreams. These are the
alternatives that lie before you. Take time to ponder
them; there is, as I have already told you, no need for
an immediate decision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When, after leaving Monella, the two were once more
alone together, Leonard burst out with the thought that
filled his mind,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know how to express my feelings. I am
full of sadness and yet of joy, and I know not which
predominates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what it will be,&rdquo; said Jack gloomily. &ldquo;You
will stay, and I shall have to return alone. What excuse
I shall give to people for leaving you here&mdash;dead to them
and to the world for ever&mdash;or whether I shall ever be
forgiven for appearing to have deserted you, God only
knows. I wish you would think a little upon all this.
For the rest, I congratulate you with all my heart. To be
the future king of so ancient and remarkable a nation, is
a piece of &lsquo;luck&rsquo; that does not fall to everybody. By
Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed with increasing earnestness, &ldquo;upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
my word I don&rsquo;t wonder at your going in for it&mdash;indeed,
if&mdash;that is&mdash;well, if I had not already set my mind upon
something else, I would chuck up the world in general and
throw in my lot with you and be your&mdash;your Prime
Minister&mdash;or State Engineer&mdash;or some other high
functionary.&rdquo; And he laughed good-naturedly at the
ideas the suggestion called up in his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us meet trouble half way,&rdquo; said Leonard
hopefully. &ldquo;The time of parting is not yet; who knows
what may turn up? Monella may make us some concession
that will meet the case. And now look here. I
have been thinking of a plan for sending a message
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack stared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How on earth?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be much of a message, and perhaps it will
never reach home; but we can try. Let us find a place
where we can get a view in the direction of &lsquo;Monella
Lodge&rsquo; and watch at night for camp fires out on the far
savanna. We must find a spot screened from observation
on this side. Then we will bring some powder up from
our stores, and flash some signals as Monella had
arranged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what good will that do? Even if they are
seen it will only be by Indians who will not understand
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind. If any Indians see them they are sure
to spread the news about; and probably the first place to
hear of it will be Daranato, the Indian village where my
old nurse Carenna lives. Matava may have told her
about the signals, or even other Indians. At any rate,
she will be pretty sure to hear of them and let Matava
know when he returns; or perhaps even send a message
down by some one going to the coast, to say that signals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
had been seen that showed we were alive on the summit
of Roraima.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack reflected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he presently said slowly. &ldquo;Yes. There is
something in the idea. We will try it; it can do no harm.
But, to be of any good, we shall have to signal frequently;
once or twice would not be of much use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely. Before long, Matava will be back from the
coast, and will hear of them, and will come out on to the
savanna at night to see them for himself. And he would
watch night after night with an Indian&rsquo;s patience till
he saw them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I suppose Monella won&rsquo;t object? We ought
not to do it without his consent. But for that awful
forest, we might even go farther; we might make an
expedition for a week or two, and get to &lsquo;Monella Lodge&rsquo;
and leave a letter there; or even to Daranato, and leave
letters to be taken to the coast by the first Indians going
that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t manage that, nor would Monella like us
to be away so long. You never know what trouble might
turn up here with these priests and their vile crew. And
that reminds me of that letter Monella read to-day. What
did you think of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An extraordinary letter! Really, I feel almost inclined
to go back to my former idea that Monella and his friends
were all mad together!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard stared aghast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! You speak of that again?&rdquo; he exclaimed,
real indignation in his tones. &ldquo;After the way everything
has come out&mdash;after all Monella&rsquo;s kindness&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack stopped him with a smile and a touch of his hand
on the other&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put the brake on, old man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
anything disrespectful. But if Monella, who already
seems to have been about the world and to have seen as
much as three ordinary men of three score years and ten&mdash;if
the point to which his memory reaches is only a
portion of his life&mdash;why, you see, he must be Methuselah,
or the Wandering Jew himself, or some other mythical
being. Already, he has puzzled me, times enough, with
his extraordinary tales; at the same time you cannot doubt
his absolute sincerity. So that if his &lsquo;complete&rsquo; memory
is to go back farther still, why&mdash;Heaven help us!&mdash;we
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t know whether we are on our heads or our heels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a short silence Leonard spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, if they had this &lsquo;Plant of Life&rsquo; with them&mdash;those
he was with&mdash;would that not in part account for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might; but it is making large demands on one&rsquo;s
credulity. But what I really mean is this. I am inclined,
at times, to think Monella a bit mad. He has a religious
mania; he has persuaded himself&mdash;and evidently, from
that letter, has been encouraged by others to believe it&mdash;that
he has a religious mission to these people. Well,
no harm in <em>that</em>, you say. No; and that he is honourable,
upright, sincere, I feel very certain. Still, he may
be self-deceived. He seems to me to be one of those
fervidly religious mystics who can persuade themselves
into almost anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet he is no fanatic. See how mild and gentle he
can be; how slow to anger, how just in his discrimination
between right and wrong!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I admit all that. Still, I repeat, he might easily
deceive himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That afternoon Leonard sought out Ulama and asked
to be allowed to row her on the lake; and to this she
smiled a glad assent. When he had rowed the boat out
a long distance from the shore, he laid down the oars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and let her drift. A gentle breeze was blowing, and this
served to temper the ardour of the waning sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the last time we were thus alone,
Ulama?&rdquo; presently he asked her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do,&rdquo; she answered, her cheek, that had of
late been very pale, now glowing with a rosy flush.
&ldquo;But I began to think <em>you</em> had forgotten, and were never
going to take me out again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! It was not my fault, Ulama.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose else could it be?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I cannot tell you now. But, if you remember
the occasion, do you remember also what we spoke of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colour deepened in the maiden&rsquo;s face. She bent
her head and fixed her eyes dreamily upon the water;
and one hand dropped over the boat&rsquo;s side, as on that
day of which he had reminded her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I then said,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that I loved you dearly,
and asked you whether you could love me in return.
And you said you did not understand such love as I
described to you. Do you remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I remember,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;But then I
said I could scarce credit such sudden love for me; and
that you might change. And it seems you have, for,
since then, you have never told me that you loved me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He seized her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Ulama,&rdquo; he cried passionately, &ldquo;it was not so.
I have not altered. But I feared&mdash;that&mdash;well, that your
father might be angered. &lsquo;Twas for that reason that I
spoke no more to you of love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that you did my father wrong,&rdquo; she answered
frankly. &ldquo;My father loves me far too well to cause me
pain and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Then&mdash;would it pain you were I to go away
from here and never see you more?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>She started, and a look of mingled fear and grief came
into her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are&mdash;not&mdash;going away?&rdquo; she faltered anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if you bid me stay, Ulama. If you but whisper
in my ear that you may come to love me&mdash;if only a little&mdash;then
I will stay&mdash;stay on always&mdash;forget my country,
my own people, my friends; give up everything, and
live for you&mdash;for you alone, my sweet, my gentle Ulama;
my beloved Ulama!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gradually her head sank until it rested on her hand;
her colour deepened, she made no reply, but still gazed
pensively into the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Ulama&mdash;am I to stay or go? Oh, say that
you will try to love me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He still retained her hand, and now he passed his own
gently over it, she making no effort to withdraw it. Thus
answered, he pressed his lips upon it, and at this, also,
she showed no resentment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have you stay,&rdquo; she presently murmured
softly; &ldquo;but indeed I fear it is too late for me to try
to love you, for my heart tells me you have my love
already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the boat drifted aimlessly in the evening light.
The sun had set, and the moon, the witness of so many
lovers&rsquo; vows&mdash;both true and false&mdash;had shown her silvery
light above the surrounding cliffs; and still the two sat
on and scarcely spoke, yet, in speechless eloquence,
recounting to each other the old, old tale.</p>

<p>And, when the sweet Ulama left the boat, her heart
could scarce contain the joy that filled it; and in her eye
there was a light that it had lacked before, so that the
king, her father, drew her affectionately to him and asked
her what had wrought this wondrous change.</p>

<p>She shyly bent her head and answered him,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow thou shalt know, my father.&rdquo; Then she
hid her blushing face upon his shoulder. &ldquo;I have a
favour to ask of thee; but&mdash;I would fain not speak of it
this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, as though fearing that he would wrest from her
the secret of her joy, she stole swiftly to her room, and
from her window looked across the lake, now shimmering
in the silver moonbeams.</p>

<p>For long she sat there motionless, dreaming youth&rsquo;s
fond dreams; dwelling, in loving tenderness, on every
word and look she could recall of Leonard while the boat
had drifted here and there, and the lap, lap, lap, of the
ripples against the sides had kept up a soft musical
accompaniment to the rhythm of love&rsquo;s heart-beats.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<span class="f8">THE GREAT DEVIL-TREE.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> pursuance of their design of making signals from
the summit of Roraima, the two friends made further
explorations of the northern side. And this led them
into an adventure, one day, that had well-nigh proved
fatal to them both.</p>

<p>On mentioning their intention to Monella, he had at
first objected; but, upon Leonard&rsquo;s reminding him of the
anxiety and distress Templemore&rsquo;s mother and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancée</i>
might be, too probably were, in, he had given a reluctant
consent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friends, Dr. Lorien and his son, talked of coming
back again,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Do you think they are likely
to make the journey with Matava, and to be coming to
seek for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly they are coming into this neighbourhood,
after orchids,&rdquo; Leonard replied; &ldquo;and, now you speak
of it&mdash;though I had not thought about it lately&mdash;the news
Matava will probably take back may cause such anxiety
that they may hurry to get here sooner than they would
otherwise have been likely to, in order to make inquiry
about us on the spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matava might lead them to the cavern, if they came
to Daranato,&rdquo; said Monella thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; of course that is possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And a very little ingenuity or a small charge of powder
would force an opening; and their way would then be
easy to get up here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella&rsquo;s face clouded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That must not be; you must clearly understand that
you must tell me in time if there seems any such probability.
I wish not to seem unfriendly towards your
friends&mdash;and personally I liked them&mdash;but to allow them
to come in here would be as the beginning of a flood,
as the letting out of water. It cannot, must not be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, after all, it is only a supposition,&rdquo; observed
Jack. &ldquo;Time enough to deal with it, if the occasion
actually arise. They were going on to Rio on some law
business which was likely to occupy them some time;
they might be detained there indefinitely, they said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; Monella answered decisively. &ldquo;Only,
remember, I rely upon you to inform me in time. And
be very cautious and vigilant upon that side of the country,
for, as you know, it is in that direction that Coryon and
his people have their habitation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In their walks they were often accompanied by one or
both of Ulama&rsquo;s pumas, and on the day referred to the
male one, &lsquo;Tuo,&rsquo; as it was called, came after them when
they had gone a little way, and trotted quietly beside
them; and this, as it turned out, saved their lives.</p>

<p>They came upon a place they had not seen before.
Two great iron gates of highly finished workmanship,
and picked out with gold, shut in a narrow opening in
a high rock. They were such as might form the entrance
to a public garden. A broad road wound round from
the inside of the gates; but outside, where Templemore
and Elwood were, the rocks rose up fifty or sixty feet,
or even more, on either side; and though they followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
them a considerable distance on both sides of the gates,
the rocks still towered up precipitously for as far as they
could see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This can scarcely be the entrance to Coryon&rsquo;s
&lsquo;domain,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;or there would be some people
about on guard. It must be some kind of public place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cemetery, perhaps,&rdquo; suggested Leonard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;ve hit it. Well, there&rsquo;s a gate open,
so I suppose there&rsquo;s no harm in our having a peep
inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose some one were on the watch, and were to
pop round and close and lock the gates when we were
inside and out of sight,&rdquo; said Leonard suspiciously.
&ldquo;Monella warned us to be wary and to suspect traps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have our revolvers; and, if the worse came to
the worst, we could climb over these rocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the result they went inside; then made their way
to a wide terrace that ran round an extensive area of
horseshoe shape, half natural, half artificial, as they
judged. This terrace extended several hundreds of yards
in both directions from the point at which they stood;
but it narrowed off considerably on one side of the
horseshoe. Above and behind it, cut out of the rock,
were other terraces, like steps or rows of seats, but
broad below and narrowing as they got higher. These
went all round, almost to the top of the rocks. It was,
in fact, a vast amphitheatre where many thousands of
people could stand or sit. At the farther end it was
open; and in the centre was a large arena sunk some
fifteen feet below the main terrace on which they stood.</p>

<p>This arena opened out into a deep defile beyond,
from the rocky heights of which there issued a rushing
stream of water that flowed into a large, dark-looking
pool below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>But what at once riveted their attention, almost to
the point of fascination, was an extraordinary-looking
tree that stood in the arena. This tree had no leaves,
but branches only. In colour it was of a sombre violet-blue,
tinged in places with a ruddy hue. The trunk was
about thirty feet in height, and eight or nine feet in
diameter. The branches, which were many&mdash;a hundred
or more probably&mdash;drooped over from where the trunk
ended and trailed about the ground. But what was most
astonishing, these branches were all in motion. Though
there was no wind, they waved to and fro, ran restlessly
along the ground like lithe snakes, and intertwined one
with another, at the same time making a harsh, rustling
sound.</p>

<p>Straight in front of where they stood was a long pier of
masonry that ran out towards the tree, which was not in
the centre of the arena but was nearer to that part of
the terrace where it grew narrow. In order the better
to observe the object that had so roused their curiosity,
the two young men walked across the terrace and some
distance along the pier; and, when they had proceeded a
little more than half its length, one of the long trailing
branches&mdash;some of them appeared to be two hundred or
three hundred feet in length&mdash;came up over the end of
the pier, and, with a rustle, made its way swiftly towards
them. It was within two or three feet of where they
stood looking at it, when the puma, with a loud growl,
sprang forward and bit at it. Immediately the branch
curled itself round the animal&rsquo;s body and began dragging
it along the pier towards the tree. Then two or three
other branches advanced and went to the assistance of
the first one, coiling round the poor puma and dragging
it farther along, despite its teeth and claws and its
desperate struggles. In succession, other branches crept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
up over the end of the stonework, and, just in time, Jack
seized Leonard and dragged him back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake come away, man!&rdquo; he exclaimed
in horror. &ldquo;That tree is <em>alive</em>, and will drag us off, if
once one of those branches touch us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had stepped back only barely in time, for a
moment after a trailing branch swept over the very spot
on which they had halted. When assured that they were
really out of reach, they stood fascinated, but filled
with horror, while they witnessed the unavailing fight
made by the poor animal that had saved their lives.
More branches came to the aid of the others; they
coiled round its mouth and closed it; round its legs
and bound them; and soon, helpless, a mere bundle
in the coiling, curling branches, as it were, it was drawn
off the pier to the ground below. Then it was rolled
on and on till it had almost reached the tree-trunk, where
were shorter but thicker and stronger branches waiting
for it. These, in their turn, soon coiled round it; then,
slowly, they bent upwards, carrying the poor animal in
their relentless grasp, and lowered it into a hollow in the
centre of the top of the trunk, where it almost disappeared
from sight. Then all the thicker branches coiled round
it and shut it completely out from view, forming a sort of
huge knot round the top of the tree and remaining
motionless; while the longer and more slender branches
continued to play restlessly about, seeking for further
prey. Then, without a word, the two turned away; nor
did they speak till they found themselves safely outside
the great gates. Then they looked, horror-struck, at each
other.</p>

<p>Jack was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What an escape!
What an awful monster! What a frightful death! And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
that poor animal&mdash;that saved us both! What shall we
say to the princess? Talk of &lsquo;traps&rsquo;! If this gate was
left open as a &lsquo;trap&rsquo;&mdash;and it looks to me so&mdash;we have
reason indeed to be thankful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <em>is</em> it?&rdquo; Leonard asked at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A &lsquo;devil-tree.&rsquo; It is a carnivorous tree. I&rsquo;ve seen
a small one before; in a forest in Brazil that we were
working through. One of the dogs got caught in it and
was nearly killed before we cut it free with our axes.
And then it was badly hurt, and so was I; a branch
caught hold of my hand and tore some of the flesh off it.
And where we cut this branch it <em>bled</em>! A dark crimson-blue
liquid oozed out that stank! Oh, there, I can&rsquo;t
tell you what the stench was like! I&rsquo;ve smelt <em>some</em> bad
smells in my time, but that beat anything I ever came
across! But that was only a small bush. I had no idea
they could grow into great flesh-eating monsters like this!
Why, that thing must have been there a thousand&mdash;ah&mdash;two
thousand years, I should say. Fully that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Leonard, &ldquo;why is it kept here? who feeds
it&mdash;and&mdash;what&mdash;is&mdash;it&mdash;fed&mdash;on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He asked this last question slowly, and looked at the
other in blank, horrified amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t live without food,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;And it
must want a lot too. Whoever can take the trouble to
get it food of the only kind&mdash;as I suppose&mdash;that it would
care for? And why is it there in the middle of that
strange place? One would almost think it was kept there
as a kind of show or curiosity; and yet&mdash;we have never
heard about it all the time we have been here! And it
is there, with the gate open, no fence to guard people, or
notice to warn them. Well! It&rsquo;s a mystery to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But if they had been astounded and horror-stricken at
what they had seen, they were still more mystified and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
upset by Ulama&rsquo;s behaviour when they told her of their
adventure; for she fainted right off and, when she
recovered, seemed so overcome with terror as to be unable
to say a word. No explanation would she give; save
that now and then she murmured, almost in a moan, to
herself,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it <em>is</em> true! And I never knew! It is horrible&mdash;too
horrible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Leonard expressed his sorrow about the puma,
she hardly seemed to notice it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah yes!&rdquo; she said once. &ldquo;Poor Tuo! I shall miss
him&mdash;and such a death, too! But oh, he saved you and
your friend! And then, he was but an animal&mdash;but the
others!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At her express desire they promised not to speak to
any one else about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you why&mdash;or you will know why&mdash;later,&rdquo; she
added. &ldquo;But you can speak privately to Monella about
it; to no one else just now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they found an opportunity of speaking to him
about it, he looked very grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have had a narrow escape,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Heaven
be thanked you did escape. I cannot explain more to
you now, but may be able to do so shortly. Meantime,
please do as the princess says, and keep this matter to
yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this time Leonard&rsquo;s relations with Ulama had
remained unchanged; they had not been placed on any
settled footing. Monella had asked him to take time to
make up his mind, and had intimated that nothing would
be said or done meanwhile. Leonard had, however,
been too impatient to put his fate to the test to be able
to wait after the encouragement Monella had given to
him. But, whether Ulama had spoken on the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
with her father, he knew not; for it so happened that he
had not seen her alone since their love-scene in the boat.</p>

<p>And now she was evidently much discomposed about
their adventure with the &lsquo;devil-tree&rsquo;; though she did
not refer to it again.</p>

<p>Naturally too, the recollection of it was very much in
the minds of the two young men. Leonard asked
Templemore, one day, what the branches of the one he
had seen were like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were covered with small excrescences,&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;that are suckers and piercers in one. They
pierce the flesh and then suck the blood. The whole
affair is a sort of gigantic vegetable &lsquo;octopus,&rsquo; or devil-fish,
only that it has a hundred or more &lsquo;arms&rsquo; or
branches instead of eight, as the octopus has. I have
heard of devil-fish having been caught as large as eighty
feet in length, on the coast of Newfoundland. But I
never knew that its vegetable prototype grew to anything
like the size.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I have seen devil-fish,&rdquo; said Leonard
thoughtfully; &ldquo;but they have a mouth&mdash;a great beak&mdash;to
which their arms carry the food. Do you think it is the
same here? You saw that the branches carried the poor
puma up into a hollow in the top of the trunk. Do you
suppose the thing has a kind of mouth there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness only knows! It must be an awful sort of
affair, if it is so. The whole thing is monstrous and
uncanny. Don&rsquo;t let us talk about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, as a result of this experience, they sought in another
direction for a likely place from which to make their
intended signals; and finally they found one convenient
for their purpose. Then they made two or three trips to
the canyon to bring up the requisite powder. They also
brought back from the secret cave a number of things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Monella wanted. From the first, at his suggestion, they
had told no one except the king, Ulama, and Zonella, of
the means by which they had gained access to the mountain;
and these had promised to keep the knowledge to
themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The place has evidently been so long unvisited,&rdquo;
Monella had remarked, &ldquo;that probably most of those
who once knew of it have forgotten all about it. No need
to remind them just now. Many years ago, as I have
been informed, a project was started for filling it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Filling it up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if you go to the other end of the canyon&mdash;that
by which we entered&mdash;you will find, even now,
in the thick wood that everywhere surrounds the top of
the canyon, vast numbers of great boulders that were
quarried from the surrounding cliffs and hauled to the
edge in readiness to be thrown down. They lie, in fact,
just over the cavern we came in by. There they have
remained for a very long time, it seems. Had that intention
been carried out, all our work in cutting through
the forest and finding the entrance to the cavern, as you
can see, would have been thrown away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what stopped it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is said that the people threatened a rebellion. The
belief in the eventual return of Mellenda&mdash;of whom you
have heard&mdash;is deep-seated; and, though the people here
are anxious enough to keep to themselves, they would not
assent to closing irrevocably the only means by which
their hero could gain admittance, should he ever come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they expect him to come with a host of followers&mdash;a
conquering army&mdash;or do they expect the great lake
to come back, and that he will arrive with a grand fleet
of ships?&rdquo; Templemore asked, with somewhat of a
sarcastic smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Monella passed his hand across his brow in the half-dreamy
manner that was his at times, as though striving
to collect his thoughts, or to arrest and force into shape
some half-formed conception that had flitted across his
mind and escaped his grasp. For a minute he stared
vacantly away into the distance and was silent. Then,
with a look as though of pain at failing to catch the fleeting
image, he turned away, saying simply,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the days that followed, Templemore passed
much of his time in the museums; time that Elwood spent
in a lover&rsquo;s dream of happiness with Ulama. In the relics
of the former history of this strange people, Templemore
took a deep interest; and in the archives and ancient
manuscripts he found many evidences of the former existence
of scientific and engineering knowledge that astonished
and perplexed him. On the true meaning and import of
some of these he sought the help of Monella, who would
frequently accompany him in these visits, and, from his
better knowledge of the language, was able to assist him
to unravel their curious contents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These people must once have been great engineers
and architects!&rdquo; he exclaimed in surprised admiration on
one of these occasions.</p>

<p>Monella smiled and made reply,</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing so surprising in that, if you comprehend
the true significance of the gigantic earthworks
still extant in many places on this continent. Have you
seen any of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but I have both heard and read of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen them; and I tell you your mind can
form no idea of their extent, of the scientific knowledge
and the prodigious amount of time and labour that must
have been expended on them, unless you actually see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
them. They are of various forms, mostly geometrical
figures upon a vast scale&mdash;miles in extent. The wonderful
thing is that a certain figure is repeated exactly in different
places hundreds of miles apart. Yet you shall take your
cleverest engineers of the present day, give them the
advantages&mdash;or supposed advantages&mdash;of all your modern
discoveries and machinery, and scientific instruments,
and, say, unlimited workpeople to do their building, and
<em>then</em> it would tax all their skill to construct a work <em>exactly</em>
similar to one of those great figures. Yet now, upon
some of them, trees are growing that must be over a
thousand years old!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what were they for&mdash;what was their object?&rdquo;
Templemore asked.</p>

<p>Then there came over the other&rsquo;s face again that
curious look as of one seeking for a lost recollection;
but it seemed to evade him, and he answered somewhat
as before,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I ought to be able to tell you,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;but I cannot now seem to remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was while thus together one day that Templemore
asked him for some further information concerning the
&lsquo;Plant of Life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have told me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that your people, with
whom you lived in that secluded valley high up in the
Andes, had with them the &lsquo;karina&rsquo; and cultivated it.
Therefore I suppose you yourself have been in the habit
of taking it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always. And in my travelling to and fro in the
world I always had with me a good supply of the dried
herb. I was accustomed to leave stores of it in certain
towns, so that if I lost what I had with me by any accident,
there was more within easy reach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. But what I am puzzled about is this: why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
if the virtues of the plant are so great, do people ever die
at all? And why do some live longer than others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to the first question,&rdquo; Monella answered, &ldquo;man
was never intended to live on this earth for ever. The
human frame <em>must</em> wear out sooner or later. As to the
second query, some constitutions are naturally stronger
than others, and these endure longer, just as is the case
in the world outside where the plant is not known. The
effect of the plant is simply to keep the blood pure, if
originally pure. If, however, there is an inherited taint,
that taint will make itself felt sooner or later and undermine
the vitality of the system. In this case the plant
will only result in ensuring a somewhat longer life than
would otherwise have been the case. Sooner or later the
vitality will fall off and gradual decay set in, although
(the blood being kept still pure) ordinary diseases are
kept at bay. Lastly, there is the question of the will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>will</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; that has a most powerful influence. If a man
who has inherited a constitution that is absolutely sound,
from ancestors who have possessed the same through
many generations, and if he has, in addition, a strong
<em>will</em>, powerful beyond the average, he may live longer&mdash;if
he is so minded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;do not understand you,&rdquo; said Templemore, somewhat
puzzled.</p>

<p>Monella gazed at him with a smile that was full of
sadness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;if you were old yourself;
if you had outlived all that made life worth having&mdash;your
wife, and others you love, your ambitions, your hopes.
<em>Then</em> does the soul grow weary, and restless as well;
it is like unto a bird that is caged whose time for migration
has come. It will either fret or pine itself to death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
or beat itself to death against the bars of its cage. Only
two things can then keep the soul from taking its flight;
the <em>will</em> to live to complete some unfinished work, or a
delight in a worldly, wicked life. A nature superlatively
evil, like Coryon&rsquo;s, may enable its possessor to live on
and on for an indefinite time; where better men take
the &lsquo;falloa&rsquo; and die. Or a man, not himself enamoured
of life upon this earth, may exert his <em>will</em> to carry out
to its end some great work to benefit his fellow-creatures,
and he too may keep the &lsquo;falloa&rsquo; at arm&rsquo;s length for an
unusually long period. In other words, the &lsquo;falloa&rsquo; is
a form of melancholia, of weariness with the world, of
an inward sense that life&rsquo;s work is completed. It is the
result of that feeling that we are told took possession
at last even of him who has been called the Wise Man
of the World&mdash;King Solomon&mdash;whose wisdom and riches
and power only brought him to the same point I have
indicated&mdash;that at which the soul declares that all earthly
things are but vanity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On another occasion, Templemore was accompanied
by Zonella and Colenna; and the latter took him into a
gallery he had not before seen, the door being usually
kept locked.</p>

<p>In it, to his surprise, were ranged hundreds of stands
of arms and military uniforms, helmets, spears, shields,
swords, daggers, and red tunics, all kept in splendid
condition, as though for instant use. All the helmets
had little silver wings at their sides, and the shields were
engraved in the centre with a strange hieroglyphic, the
same that he had noticed chiselled upon the fronts of
many of the principal buildings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Colenna, &ldquo;are the arms and uniforms
of Mellenda&rsquo;s soldiers. Over in Myrlanda, in the great
temple of the White Priests, are hundreds more; all kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
ready for use, as you see these here. You see the
silver wings upon the helmets, similar to those on that
of Mellenda&rsquo;s suit that stands in the other gallery. And
that figure upon the shields is the sacred sign that was
engraved upon his signet-ring. It signifies his seal or
sign-manual. Wherever you see that mark, it refers
to him; on a building it implies that he designed or
built it. His royal colour was red, as the king&rsquo;s to-day
is blue; and these red tunics are for his soldiers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When they come,&rdquo; said Jack, discreetly repressing
the incredulous smile that almost forced itself upon his
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When <em>he</em> comes,&rdquo; said Colenna, lifting his hat reverently.
&ldquo;Yes, when <em>he</em> returns to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in that, I know,&rdquo; interposed Zonella;
&ldquo;yet we all do; and it is a good thing we do, I think,
for I fear many in the land would go mad under their
dread of Coryon, if they did not believe in a happier
future for the country. But there,&rdquo; she added sadly,
&ldquo;it does not matter to <em>you</em>. You have no interest in
what may go on here in the future. You intend to go
back to your own country, and care little for the sorrows
or the fate of those you leave behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Colenna had walked away some little distance, to
examine a shield that he thought was not quite so
bright as it should be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not care!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed, impulsively. &ldquo;Why,
how can you say that? It is that thought that grieves
me all the time I am here; that makes me doubt how I
shall ever be able to make up my mind to leave. To
leave behind one&rsquo;s dearest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zonella turned to him quickly, with a heightened colour
and a bright look. This was so unexpected that he
stopped and hesitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You said your dearest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dearest friend, Leonard&mdash;of course,&rdquo; he answered,
looking at her in some surprise.</p>

<p>But Zonella&rsquo;s face paled, and she turned away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; she said with a shiver, as though a cold
wind had blown upon her. &ldquo;This old gallery is kept
locked up so much it gets to smell musty, and makes
one feel quite faint.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<span class="f8">SMILES AND TEARS.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">One</span> morning, Monella sought Leonard and reverted
to their former conversation about Ulama.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have well considered all the words I spoke to
you, my son?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Are you still of the same
mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had hoped that you knew me too well to think it
necessary to ask the question,&rdquo; Leonard said earnestly.
&ldquo;Since I first looked upon Ulama, my love for her has
been given past all recall. I have never wavered in my
resolution to remain here for her dear sake, if I may hope
to gain the king&rsquo;s consent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; returned Monella, &ldquo;the king would talk with
you concerning it. Let us go to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, without further preface, he led the young man
into the private chamber of King Dranoa, where he left
him.</p>

<p>The king, Leonard thought, looked ill and careworn;
but he received him with great kindness, and in a manner
that quickly reassured the anxious lover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been no secret to me for some time,&rdquo; said
Dranoa, &ldquo;that thou hast looked with affection upon my
child. She, too, hath spoken to me; I see that she
hath set her heart upon this thing, and I love her too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
dearly to desire to thwart her wishes, unless for some
weighty reason. Here I see no such reason; for, though
thou art a stranger, yet thou art worthily recommended
by one upon whose judgment I have learned to place
reliance. He that led thee hither is not a man to act
lightly or without full consideration in a matter of such
paramount importance; if thou hast gained his confidence
and esteem, I doubt not that there are good reasons for it.
He hath the unerring eye that pierces to the very heart,
and that no hypocrisy, no cunning, can deceive. Were it
the case that my dominions were to-day the great empire
over which my forefathers held sway, I would seek such
a man&rsquo;s advice in the appointment of my generals, my
ministers, my governors for distant districts. Therefore
do I feel that I can rely upon his judgment, even in a matter
so momentous as the choice of one to espouse my child
and to succeed me on my throne. And knowing, as I do
full well, that the &lsquo;falloa&rsquo; hath laid its hand upon me and
that my days in this my land are numbered, it is grateful to
mine heart to feel that my child will be comforted, when I
am gone, by one whose affection for her is pure and wholly
hers, and who will have at his side a friend and counsellor
who will guide his youthful steps in the path that I would
have him follow. This conviction hath lifted from mine heart
a grievous trouble, and hath enabled me to bear without
sorrow or regret the knowledge that the fatal sickness hath
taken hold upon me. For the fact that I shall now soon
quit this earthly life I care nothing in itself; it hath been
the fear of what would then befall that hath filled me with
forebodings and with fear. But, if I see&mdash;as I hope to see&mdash;the
power of the Black Coryon broken and destroyed for
ever; my child wedded to one worthy of her love and
honour; my successor aided and advised by one so competent
to guide as is thy friend, then indeed I shall feel I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
can lay down the burden of life with thanksgiving, and
take my way to the great unknown of the hereafter without
fear, without regret, without a sigh; but, instead, with
the great content of one who feels he hath nothing more
to wish or hope for upon earth. For know, my son,&rdquo; continued
Dranoa with grave emphasis, &ldquo;no man wisheth to
prolong his life for that which it hath yielded, but rather
for that which he is hopeful it may yield. The proof of
this is easy; no man desireth to live his life over again;
therefore he is, at heart, and from actual experience,
dissatisfied and wearied with life; not charmed with it.
Yet do many cling to it, fatuously believing, in the face of
all their own actual experience, that it shall yet, in the
future, afford them joys and gratifications they have never
found in the past. These, my son, are the words of
one who hath lived long enough to gain the wisdom that
teacheth how to sift the wheat from the chaff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dranoa paused, and remained silent awhile. Then he
resumed, with a change of tone,</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I wish not to weigh down thy young imaginings
with the sober knowledge that belongeth not to thine years
but to mine. It will be sufficient to give thee counsel
that is more suited to the circumstances. Therefore I say
this to thee: thou hast a good heart and good instincts&mdash;trust
them, follow them honestly; and leave the rest
to the Great Spirit that ruleth over all. And now I have
but one more thing to say; it were better for the present
that this that is between us were not known openly.
Personally, that will not concern thee. When the time
hath come, I will myself announce it to my people. Meanwhile,
thy mind will be at rest with the knowledge of my
approval of thy suit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard gratefully poured out his thanks to the kind-hearted
king; then went to seek Ulama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>He found her sitting alone in an apartment that overlooked
the lake, so deep in thought that she did not hear
his coming. She was leaning on the window-sill gazing
pensively upon the beauties of the scene that lay outspread
before her.</p>

<p>But Leonard thought, as he caught sight of her and
stayed his steps upon the threshold, that she herself was
the fairest creation of all, posed as she was with that
unconscious grace and charm that seemed with her to be
innate. For a full minute he stood in silence; then,
still without moving towards her, he softly called her
name, as though fearing to approach her till he had
permission.</p>

<p>She turned her head towards him with no surprise,
but with a look of sweetest pleasure in her gentle eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not hear you,&rdquo; she said dreamily, &ldquo;and yet&mdash;I
know not why&mdash;I was looking for your coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what were you thinking of so profoundly, sweet
Ulama?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;how much more beautiful
our lake and its surroundings have seemed to me of
late. I scarce noticed them before; I suppose because I
have known them all my life. Yet, now that you have
pointed out some of their beauties, I not only feel and
appreciate them, but I note many others on all sides that
I never saw before. It is very strange! I wonder why
it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is <em>love</em>, Ulama,&rdquo; Leonard said, coming quietly to her
side and laying his hand lightly on her shoulder. &ldquo;Love
can make the plainest works of nature beautiful; small
wonder then if it makes those that are really so display
new and unsuspected charms. It is because love has
taken up his dwelling in your heart that you now see new
beauties in these familiar scenes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>But Ulama shook her head sagely, and smilingly made
answer,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know you told me that the first time you saw our
lake you deemed it the fairest spot on all the earth. And
you did not know me then, so could not love me. How
then can what you say explain it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard laughed and took her hand in his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget that I had seen you in my dreams and had
loved you long before,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps some instinct
told me that here I should find the abode of her who
already had my heart. Or, if that explanation does not
please you, here is another. Love and sympathy are
inseparable; you admire, now, things that you thought
little of before, because you see that <em>I</em> admire them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; that may be,&rdquo; Ulama admitted, with a thoughtful
look. &ldquo;But then, it does not explain why <em>you</em> should
see beauties where <em>I</em> did not. I think you must have a
quicker appreciation of the beautiful in nature than is
given to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be so; and that in turn explains how it came
about that I was so quick to realise the beauty of the
fairest daughter of Manoa!&rdquo; And Leonard&rsquo;s look was so
tender, so full of loving admiration, that it brought a rosy
glow to Ulama&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;And it also reminds me that I
sought you here to tell you something of importance,
something that has brought joy and gladness to my heart.
I have just been talking about you with the king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colour in the girl&rsquo;s cheek grew deeper; and now
she turned her glance again upon the landscape that lay
sleeping in the morning sunlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear love,&rdquo; continued Leonard, &ldquo;think what it means
to me&mdash;to both of us, I hope&mdash;when I tell you that the king
has given me permission to ask you to give yourself to
me! Ah! Not only has he done that, but he has done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
it in a manner&mdash;accompanied it with kind words of trust
and confidence that have filled my whole heart with
gratitude. He speaks as though I had already <em>proved</em>
that which I can only hope to show in the future&mdash;my
true desire to make myself worthy of your love. His
kindness and many marks of friendship towards one who
is but a stranger here have overwhelmed me. I feel the
whole devotion of my life to you and him can scarce
repay such generous, ungrudging proofs of his confidence
and favour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a good friend in Monella,&rdquo; Ulama said
quietly. &ldquo;He never fails to speak well of you when
occasion offers. And he is one of our own race, and has
had great experience of the world outside, of which we
know nothing; and my father knows he can rely on his
opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that is true, dear love, and my heart
burns with gratitude to him too. And now, beloved&rdquo;&mdash;and
he put his arms round her and drew her to him&mdash;&ldquo;may I
not think of you as all my own? Let me hear you say
with those dear lips that you know now what love is, that
it has sprung up unforced in your pure heart; let me hear
you say, &lsquo;Leonard, I love you!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, as he drew her closer to him and her head
nestled upon his shoulder, a whisper, that seemed but a
faint sigh, breathed softly the words so sweet to hear
for the first time from a loved-one&rsquo;s lips&mdash;&ldquo;I love
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later in the day Leonard told Templemore of his
interview with the king; and, as he did so, a look
came over his face that, as his friend expressed it to
himself, &ldquo;did one&rsquo;s heart good to see, even if but once
in a lifetime!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In your happiness I too feel happy, dear old boy,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
he said. &ldquo;And I should have little concern, for the time
being, if only those at home knew we were alive and
well. As it is, the thought of their anxiety troubles me
unceasingly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us hope our signal flares were seen and will be
reported,&rdquo; Leonard answered. &ldquo;I think they must have
been seen; and, if so, Carenna is sure to hear of it, and
will find some way of sending word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This referred to what they had done to carry out
Leonard&rsquo;s suggestion. After some perseverance in
watching from the spot they had selected, they saw, one
evening, camp fires far out on the savanna. At once they
made their signals with small heaps of powder, and these
they repeated several times. No response whatever
came; nor did they expect any. There was nothing for
it but to wait patiently in the hope that their signals had
been seen.</p>

<p>Then ensued a time, lasting many weeks, which was
almost uneventful. To Leonard and Ulama it was one
uninterrupted dream of blissful happiness. To Templemore
it was pleasant and interesting, for he found plenty
to engage his mind. He studied the designs of the chief
buildings; of the bridges that spanned the streams that
fed the lake. In the arches and general construction of
these he formed engineering ideas that were new to him.
He visited often the great waterfall that formed the outlet
of the lake, and declared that the sight of the vast
body of water shooting out in its leap of two thousand
feet, its deep, thundering roar, and the play of colour
when the sun shone into the mist and spray, made up a
combination that threw Niagara itself&mdash;which he had seen&mdash;into
the shade.</p>

<p>One day, when Ulama and Zonella were alone together,
the former thus addressed her friend,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes of late I have fancied there has been some
unpleasant passage between you and Leonard&rsquo;s friend.
I myself am so fortunate, so happy, that I like not to see
those about me otherwise. I would have all my friends
as happy as myself.&rdquo; And she took Zonella&rsquo;s hand and
rubbed her face affectionately against it. &ldquo;Tell me,
Zonella, have you two quarrelled?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Zonella&rsquo;s face, usually so pleasant to
behold, looked hard and almost fierce. Then it softened,
and, with a loud cry, she threw her arms around Ulama;
she hid her face in the gentle bosom, and burst into a
torrent of impassioned tears.</p>

<p>It was some time before Ulama, greatly surprised as
well as pained and puzzled, could understand the meaning
of this outburst; but presently Zonella, growing somewhat
calmer, sobbed out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! <em>You</em>&mdash;you little know, little think what I have
suffered. He cares no more for me than he does for you&mdash;perhaps
less. His heart is elsewhere; he is set upon
going away from our land, and only his regard for his
friend delays him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ulama&rsquo;s beautiful face bent over Zonella&rsquo;s, and her tears
fell upon the other&rsquo;s cheek as she pressed her lovingly to
her bosom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! Alas! My poor Zonella! And is it possible
that love, which has been so sweet to me, should bring to
you but pain and suffering? I almost fear for my own
happiness; that my selfishness in yielding to it has
blinded me to what was going on with the others. But it
never occurred to me that love that is to me so wonderful
in the joy and pleasure it confers, could also be the cause
of misery and sorrow. And yet,&rdquo; she added thoughtfully,
&ldquo;you are not without one to love you. Poor Ergalon has
long been faithful to his love for you. Oh, how strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and contrary it all seems! Poor fellow! Perhaps you
have made him suffer even as you yourself have suffered.
Can his love not console you? I know so little myself
that what I say may be only foolishness, yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zonella smiled faintly, and shook her head. Then she
kissed the other tenderly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us say no more, my dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am sorry
I gave way as I did; but you took me by surprise.
Perhaps, too, your implied advice is wise. It might be
better to try to love the one you <em>know</em> does truly love
you, than to fret your heart out after one who loves you
not, and who is beyond your reach. At least, as you say,
there <em>is</em> one in the world who loves me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the time sped on. Monella was much away;
sometimes for a week together; so the young men saw
comparatively little of him. Templemore, on one occasion,
expressed a wish to visit Myrlanda with him, but Monella
said there were difficulties in the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is better you two should remain here for the
present,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;At a future time, let us hope
it may be different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But one day Monella came to him with a look of gravity
that at once aroused his interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I should show you something
of the truth, that you may understand what lies
before us. Can you brace up your courage and your
nerve to stand a severe trial?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Templemore opened his eyes in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Need you ask?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Have you ever
known me wanting in courage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, no. But this that I refer to requires courage of
a different sort. Yet it must be faced. But I warn you
it will be a shock. Make up your mind to a test that will
tax all the nerve you can summon to your aid.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And Leonard too?&rdquo; Jack inquired, wondering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Say nothing to him. Let his dream be happy
while it may. Be ready to come out with me to-night,
when Ergalon shall come to seek you. And bring your
rifle.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<span class="f8">THE DEVIL-TREE BY MOONLIGHT.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was about ten o&rsquo;clock when Templemore, with
Ergalon as guide, came out from the king&rsquo;s palace by
a side-entrance that was little used, and the door of which
the latter now opened with a key. Outside, at a short
distance, they found Monella pacing up and down.</p>

<p>Before leaving, Templemore had told Leonard just so
much as would explain his absence; then had managed
to slip away unobserved by their friends of the king&rsquo;s
court.</p>

<p>The night was fine but chilly, and all three were muffled
up. In the sky overhead the moon shone calm and clear,
lighting up the valley with great distinctness; but across
its face wild-looking clouds were scurrying, showing that
a strong wind was blowing up above, though little of it
was felt below. Only now and then an eddying gust
would sweep down the hillside and stir the trees around
them, then die away with a rustling sigh or a low
moan.</p>

<p>Ergalon led the way; skirting the town he took a
roundabout road that Templemore soon saw led to the
neighbourhood of the scene of their adventure with the
devil-tree, though they were approaching it from a different
direction. Finally, they entered a thick wood that covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
a steep hill; and now Templemore&rsquo;s companions made
signs to him to observe strict silence and to proceed as
quietly as possible. When they had reached the summit
of the slope, and stood on the ridge within the shadow
of the trees, which here ceased abruptly, Templemore
uttered a half-smothered exclamation. Instantly, he felt
Monella&rsquo;s heavy hand upon his shoulder grasping him
with a grip of iron; and it brought to him the recollection
of the caution he had received.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever you see or hear,&rdquo; Monella had rejoined,
&ldquo;you must remain absolutely quiet and utter no sound;
do nothing that might betray our presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What had excited Templemore&rsquo;s surprise was the fact
that he found himself looking down into the great amphitheatre
in which stood the well-remembered tree. Its
long trailing branches were still moving about swiftly
in their strange, restless fashion; but most of the shorter
and thicker branches were curled up at the top of the
trunk in the same kind of <em>knot</em> as they had formed after
carrying thither the body of the puma. Viewed in the
bright moonlight, the tree was a hideous monstrosity
that had yet a certain terrible fascination which attracted
and retained the sight while it revolted and repelled
the mind. The coiled branches upon the top reminded
one irresistibly of the snakes entwined round the head
of the Medusa; they formed a kind of crown, of a
character suitable to the frightful monster whose formless
head, if one may so term it, they encircled. The appearance
of the whole thing was repulsive, ghastly, ghoulish.
There was that in the mere form and outline of this
gruesome wonder of the vegetable world that instinctively
aroused aversion. Its naked branches&mdash;that in ordinary
circumstances could belong only to a dead tree&mdash;its colour&mdash;half
funereal, half of a deep blood-tint almost unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
amongst botanical productions&mdash;its never ceasing movement,
so suggestive of an everlasting hunting after prey,
of an insatiable craving for its hateful diet of flesh and
blood, of sleepless hunger, of tireless rapacity and relentless
cruelty&mdash;all these made up an unnatural creation
that appalled the instincts and chilled the very blood
of those who looked upon it. This had been the feeling,
or combination of feelings, that had made itself felt in
Templemore&rsquo;s mind when he had first seen the spectacle
by daylight; it impressed itself much more strongly now
that he saw the tree in the cold moonlight&mdash;now standing
out clear and well-defined, now plunged into semi-obscurity,
as the hurrying clouds chased each other across the sky
above and threw their fleeting shadows beneath.</p>

<p>From the spot where the three men stood a clear view
was presented of the opposite side of the enclosure&mdash;<abbr><i>i.e.</i></abbr>,
of the side nearest to the tree, which was there sufficiently
close to the main terrace for its branches to sweep over
it; but the terrace was here protected by a covered-way
or verandah formed of metal gratings, the interstices
in which were small enough to keep the dreadful writhing
snake-like branches from pushing through them. When
Templemore had seen the place before, this part of the
terrace had been open; for the metal screens, or gratings,
were, in reality, sliding shutters that could be withdrawn
into grooves in the rock beyond. Here, at the end of the
covered-way, was a gateway that formed the entrance to
the labyrinth of caverns and galleries in the cliff in which
Coryon and his adherents lived.</p>

<p>These sliding screens were movable at the will of those
within the gateway. They could be either moved along
in their grooves and thus protect those traversing the
covered-way, or withdrawn, so that the branches of the
fatal tree, in that case, guarded the entrance most effectually;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
for no man might then venture to approach the
gateway and live.</p>

<p>Underneath, there were cells in the terrace, also within
reach of the tree; and screened off, in like manner, by
sliding grated doors. Through these gratings came faint
beams of light.</p>

<p>Templemore noted all these things; yet, while his gaze
wandered to them, each time the tree itself attracted it
again and seemed to hold it spell-bound; and he waited&mdash;waited,
hardly daring to breathe; waited for he knew not
what; waited as one expectant and oppressed by a dim
unshapen foreshadowing of some new and nameless horror.</p>

<p>Nor was it without reason; for, slowly, the coiled
&lsquo;crown&rsquo; unfolded, and <em>something</em> came little by little into
view. Gradually the <em>something</em> rose out of the hollow in
the trunk, was carried up clear of it, then lowered over
the side towards the ground. In shape it was cylindrical,
and of a colour that could not be discovered in the fitful
moonlight. Soon it was deposited upon the ground, and
the branches that had lowered it released their hold, and
it remained for a brief space untouched. Then other
branches crept up to it with tortuous twistings and, coiling
round it, raised and swung it to and fro, then quickly
dropped it. Anon, yet other branches would do the same;
only, in their turn, to drop it or to hand it on to others.
Thus was <a href="#ill01">it passed about; now lifted high in the air by
one end, then by the other</a>, anon dangled horizontally in
mid-air. In time it made the circuit of the tree; but each
branch, or set of branches that laid hold of it, rejected it
eventually, as though, by some fell but unfailing instinct,
they knew there was nothing left in it to minister to their
hateful appetite. And all the while the shadows came
and went, and the moon looked down between them and
lighted up the hideous scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime, from out the dark and filthy water and thick
slime of the large pool a few hundred yards away, crawled
uncouth monsters the like of which Templemore had
never looked upon, save, perhaps, in some fanciful representations
of creatures said to have existed in pre-historic
times. These mis-shapen reptiles were from ten to
twelve feet in length. They had heads and tails like
crocodiles, and in many other respects resembled them;
but in place of the usual scales they were covered with
large horny plates several inches in diameter; and in the
centre of each plate was a strong spine or spike, thick
at the base but sharp at the point, and four or five inches
long.</p>

<p>These creatures crawled up to the fateful tree; and it
was quickly evident that they came to claim their share in
the foul repast&mdash;the dry husk and bones from which the
tree had sucked the rest. Their armour made them safe
against the tree; for the branches no sooner touched
their bodies than they recoiled, baffled by the sharp points
they everywhere encountered. Two or three of these
horrid reptiles began to drag the dead body towards their
haunt, and finally carried it away, but not without several
tussles with the twisting, curling branches which seemed
loth to relinquish their prey; or, perhaps, wished to play
with it a little longer, as a cat might with a mouse.</p>

<p>Monella had handed his field-glass to Templemore,
still keeping a hand upon his shoulder. The young man
placed it to his eyes, and in an instant gasped out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great heavens! <em>It is a human body!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes!&mdash;if that may be so called which was but the
mutilated husk of what had once been a living, breathing,
human being! But now there was little left beyond a
shapeless form!</p>

<p>Templemore felt sick, and almost reeled; but Monella&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
grasp up-held him, and was a silent reminder that he was
expected to master his emotions, however strong and
painful they might be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no time to give way,&rdquo; Monella whispered in his
ear. &ldquo;Wait and watch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was, however, almost more than Templemore could
do. He felt like Dante led by his guide to witness the
tortures of the damned. But here, as it seemed to him,
was a scene that rivalled in horror, if not in agony, even
the scenes in the &lsquo;Inferno.&rsquo; He set his teeth and clenched
his hands; his breath was laboured, and his heart almost
stood still. But for Monella&rsquo;s hold upon his shoulder he
must have fallen.</p>

<p>But now there came out of the covered-way two
figures; they stood on the terrace and bent their gaze
upon the scene, silent and motionless. They were
dressed in flowing robes of black, or some dark colour,
that were emblazoned on the breast with a golden star.</p>

<p>Grim, weird figures were they; their dark forms
showing sharply against the light-coloured rocks behind
them, the while they gazed with cruel composure upon
the ghastly contention between the loathsome reptiles and
the tree.</p>

<p>When it was ended, and the beasts had disappeared
with their prey into the dark waters of the pool, one of
the figures on the terrace put a whistle to his mouth, and
a low piping sound reached the ears of the concealed
watchers.</p>

<p>Immediately a rumbling noise was heard; and one of
the sliding gratings beneath the terrace rolled back, thereby
disclosing a cavernous cell, in which was a lighted
lamp on a rough table. Then a figure seated by it, his
face buried in his hands, sprang up with a loud cry, and
retreated into the thick gloom beyond. But the terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
trailing branches swept in after him, twined round his
legs and threw him down, then quickly drew him out feet
foremost. Vainly he shrieked, and clutched at this and
that; at the table, at the edge of the sliding door; relentlessly,
inexorably, he was dragged from one futile hold
to another, upsetting the lamp in his struggles, till he was
outside. Other branches swooped down upon him, coiling
round him in all directions, and stifling his cries as,
slowly, with an awful deliberation and absence of hurry,
or even of the appearance of effort, he was hauled high
into the air and disappeared into the hollow of the fatal
tree. The great branches silently arranged themselves
into their knot-like circle; at another sound of the low
whistle the sliding door returned to its place with a sullen
rumble, and the two dark-robed spectators turned and left
the place.</p>

<p>Then Monella and Ergalon also came away; and it is
no disparagement of Templemore&rsquo;s courage or &lsquo;nerve&rsquo; to
state that they had almost to carry him between them.
When they had got to a safe distance, Monella placed him
on a boulder, and held to his lips a flask containing a
strong cordial. Templemore, who had been on the point
of fainting, felt revived by it at once; the liquid seemed
to course quickly through his veins, and the feeling of
deadly sickness, after a time, passed away.</p>

<p>Monella, meanwhile, contemplated him with compassion
and concern, but said no word. Presently Templemore
gasped out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;What horrors! What frightful, cold-blooded atrocity!
What a race of foul fiends! Great heavens! To think
such things go on in this fair land&mdash;a land that seems so
peaceful, so contented, so free from ordinary pain and
suffering!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my son,&rdquo; replied Monella, and there was an indescribable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
sadness in his tones, &ldquo;<em>now</em> you can understand
the great horror in the land; that which has oppressed
it for many long ages; that casts a gloom upon people&rsquo;s
lives; that turns to gall and bitterness what, but for it,
would be a life of innocent enjoyment.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;OTHER BRANCHES SWOOPED DOWN, COILING ROUND HIM.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Page 252.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;But why&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; Templemore exclaimed almost
fiercely; but the other checked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I know what you would say,&rdquo; Monella went
on. &ldquo;You would know two or three things, I think. To
the first question (as I read it) I reply that the reason you
have not heard of this thing from other people is that
they have learned, from long habit, never to refer to it,
even to one another. Almost incredible, you think?
Not more so than are many things that happen in your
own life, in your own country. I could name many
known to all, yet alluded to by none&mdash;often wrongly, as
I hold. Still, there is the fact. It is the same here.
This horror in the land broods over, enthrals the people;
yet, because they hold it in such dread, they make an
affectation of pretending not to know of its existence;
perhaps, in mercy to their children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next, it surprises you that <em>I</em> have not told you sooner.
The answer is simple. You are not like myself; I am
one of this people; you are but a sojourner in the land&mdash;a
visitor. I had the desire to make your sojourn here
as pleasant as it could be; that your interest in the
many curious things you see about you should not be
lessened, nor your stay here rendered unhappy by the
knowledge of that which you have seen to-night&mdash;the
earlier knowledge of which could have done no good to
any one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lastly, you naturally desire to know why, in that
case, I have now chosen to enlighten you. For this
reason: the time is approaching when certain plans of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
mine and of the king&rsquo;s will be completed, and when I
devoutly hope we may be able, with God&rsquo;s help, to end
this thing for ever. In that I shall ask you to help us&mdash;I
hope you will aid us all you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Templemore impetuously. &ldquo;Against
such a hellish crew as that I am with you heart and soul.
I think I begin to understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I never doubted your readiness to take part
with us. But it was necessary to give you absolute proof
of what goes on, that you might understand those with
whom we have to deal. You have now seen for yourself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, I have seen!&rdquo; Jack shuddered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And will now understand that, when the time
comes to extirpate this serpent brood, there must be no
hesitation, no paltering, no half-and-half measures, no
mercy. It will be of no use to kill the old snakes and
leave the brood to grow up again, or eggs to hatch. Do
you take in my meaning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and think you will be right and well justified.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. If you wonder why, knowing all this, I have
done nothing heretofore, it is that the king&rsquo;s plans could
not sooner be matured. Meantime we have stayed the
horror for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack uttered an impatient exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Monella declared, &ldquo;we <em>have</em>, and you have
helped to do it. These wretched creatures you have seen
sacrificed to this horrible &lsquo;fetish-tree&rsquo; of theirs, are their
own soldiers&mdash;those who escaped from us by running
away. They deserve no pity. They themselves have
given many an innocent victim&mdash;even women and
children&mdash;to that tree&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that to be true,&rdquo; Ergalon interposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truce we forced on Coryon,&rdquo; resumed Monella<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
&ldquo;has had this effect at least&mdash;it has saved the lives of
numbers of poor creatures who would have been seized
and sacrificed during the time that we have been here.
Instead of that, however, the arch-fiend Coryon has had
to content himself with making victims of his own wretched
myrmidons by way of punishment for their running
away from us. They are as bad as he&mdash;very nearly.
At any rate they are not worth your pity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am glad to hear that, at least,&rdquo; said Templemore.
&ldquo;It takes away a little of the load of horror that
turned me sick. Truly, of all the diabolical atrocities
that the mind of man in its depths of cruelty and
wickedness ever conceived&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ergalon shuddered now in his turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can look on at the sacrifice of victims such as
these,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;because I know that every one
of them has deserved his fate by acts of cruelty; but
when it is a case, as it has been in the past, of women,
young girls, and poor little children&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake say no more,&rdquo; Jack entreated;
&ldquo;I begin to feel sick again at such suggestions! I
will fight to the death against such wretches. As it
is, for the rest of my life I shall see before me in my
dreams what I saw to-night. Surely no wilder phantasy,
no more outrageous, blood-curdling nightmare ever entered
the most disordered brain. And now it will haunt me
to my life&rsquo;s end!&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<span class="f8">TRAPPED!</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">One</span> day the king announced his intention to fix
a day for Leonard&rsquo;s formal betrothal to Ulama
according to the usage of the country. Immediately the
people began preparations to do honour to the event;
and congratulations and marks of friendship and goodwill
were showered upon the young couple by all those
who were well affected towards the king.</p>

<p>In the opposite camp, however, as might be expected,
the announcement was differently received; and, indeed,
the crafty Coryon took advantage of it to sow dissension
among some of the people, and to suggest opposition to
the proposal. His adherents had certain supporters in
the land; people who bought their own security by aiding
Coryon secretly against their neighbours. This was why
the king had shrunk from pushing matters to the extreme
against the priest. He knew that these half-hearted or
doubtful ones were quite as likely to side with Coryon,
at the last moment, as with himself, and that thus a civil
war would be inaugurated.</p>

<p>Monella, since he had come into the country and
espoused the king&rsquo;s side, had thrown more energy and
method into the cause than had been previously bestowed
upon it. Through the Fraternity of the White Priests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
and their covert friends and sympathisers, and through
Ergalon, who had secretly gained over some of Coryon&rsquo;s
people, an active work had been carried on amongst all
classes, and with satisfactory results. But Coryon, on his
side, had been busy too; though hitherto with less
success. Now, however, he found a useful aid in the
objection many felt to seeing the king&rsquo;s only daughter
wedded to one who&mdash;as it was cunningly suggested to
them&mdash;was a stranger, an adventurer, come from no one
knew where, and unable to show such evidence of descent
and other qualifications as should entitle him to seek
alliance with the daughter of their king.</p>

<p>But Coryon&rsquo;s emissaries worked silently and unseen;
and there was nothing outwardly to show that two undercurrents
were gradually gaining strength and approaching
that point whence the slightest accident might bring them
into active opposition.</p>

<p>Indeed, in announcing the proposed betrothal, the king
had, for once, acted directly against Monella&rsquo;s advice.
The latter had counselled that the matter should be kept
secret until the contest with Coryon&mdash;now in abeyance&mdash;had
been finally decided; for he foresaw the use to which
Coryon would put it.</p>

<p>Leonard and Ulama were too much taken up with each
other and with their own happiness to trouble themselves
about the &lsquo;pros and cons&rsquo; that had weighed in the minds
of Monella and those who thought with him. That the
effect of the proclamation would be to hasten his marriage
was, of course, sufficient to commend it to Leonard; and
he left all the rest to others.</p>

<p>Templemore knew not sufficient of what was going on
around him to have any opinion upon the subject. Since
the night when the real use to which the great devil-tree
was put had been revealed to him, he had been very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
unhappy. He felt as might one who had been slumbering
peacefully in sight of a terrible peril, to whose existence
he had suddenly been awakened. Not that he had
any fear for his own safety; yet he was filled with a
nameless dread, a vague sense of horror and distrust, of
unreality, in the life about him. He could not but realise
that there would be no real peace, no security for life or
property, until an absolute end had been put to Coryon
and his atrocious crew, and their abominable fetish-tree
destroyed. But when would that be? he wondered.
His sense of disquiet was increased by having to keep
from Leonard the knowledge he had gained, and being
thus debarred from discussing matters with him. Not,
however (as he acknowledged to himself), that that would
have been of much advantage; for Leonard was too much
absorbed in &lsquo;love&rsquo;s young dream&rsquo; to be likely to discuss
such things coolly and critically.</p>

<p>Three days before that fixed for the ceremony of
betrothal, which was to be marked by a still grander
entertainment, the king gave a preliminary <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i>. There
was much feasting for all and sundry; boats, gaily
decorated with flowers and banners and coloured streamers,
glided to and fro upon the lake; the young people skilled
in diving from great heights into the water with their
parachute aids, contended for prizes, and there were
many other forms of gaiety and festivity.</p>

<p>Leonard and Ulama, seated upon a terrace, looked upon
the scene, and waved their hands in frequent recognition
of friendly faces and signals here and there amongst the
crowd. Ulama&rsquo;s lovely face was radiant, and the soft
light in her gentle eyes, her pleased acknowledgment of the
tokens of affection and the good wishes she received on
every side, and her grateful smiles for all, were charming
to behold. Her wondrous grace and beauty seemed, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
possible, enhanced by her half-shy, half-proud glances, and
the flush that mounted to her cheeks when she turned her
eyes with love on Leonard. Never before, even in that
country where the charms of the daughters of the land
exceed the average, had such a vision of lovely maidenhood
and such rare beauty been beheld. And yet all those who
knew her, loved her as much for the innocence and sweetness
that beamed ever in her face and guided all her
thoughts and words and actions, as for the physical perfection
that compelled their admiration.</p>

<p>She stole her little hand into her lover&rsquo;s and sighed
quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so happy, and yet my eyes are full of tears.
And I feel half frightened too; frightened lest my happiness
should be too great to last. Is it wrong, then, to be
happy, think you? It almost seems so, when I know so
many others are unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard fondly pressed her hand, and gazed deep down
into her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you feel happy in your love, dear heart,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;it is because you love so much; and surely to love cannot
be wrong, or to take pleasure in it. Besides, in that
you think so much of others you but show your sweet
unselfishness. Therefore, trouble not yourself about the
regrets for others that accompany your love. For, if to-day
they sorrow, they have had their times of happiness
in the past, or may have them in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; replied Ulama. &ldquo;I doubt whether in all
the world there is another maiden who loves as I do, and
therefore who could know the dread that weighs me down.
But as for me&mdash;ah, I tremble at my own great joy, and
fear it is too great to last. And every one is so kind to
me and seems so rejoiced to see me happy&mdash;that&mdash;that I
can hardly keep from crying.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>And for a brief minute the gentle-hearted girl placed
her hands before her face to hide her tears&mdash;tears that
were born of the great gladness of her love and her tender
sympathy for others.</p>

<p>And so for these two the day passed, like many that
had gone before it, in a blissful dream; but it was a
dream from which they were soon to be roughly awakened
to the dark knowledge of what wickedness can achieve.</p>

<p>For, amid the feasting and among the revellers, were
evil beings who had plotted in their black hearts to kill
the joy of the gentlest-hearted maiden that ever with her
sweetness brightened this sorrow-laden earth; wretches
that even then were spinning around her the treacherous
web designed by the fell Coryon to end her dream of
happiness for ever.</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p>When Templemore woke up the next morning he
gazed about him in surprise. He was not in his usual
sleeping apartment; but, instead, in some room that was
strange to him. It was small, dingy and ill-lighted,
and the couch upon which he found himself was not that
on which he had lately slept. He sprang up and, in
vague alarm, looked round for his clothes and his arms;
the clothes were there, but there was no revolver, and
his rifle was nowhere to be seen. Even his sword and
dagger, that formed part of his usual dress, had been
removed. Dressing himself hastily, he rushed to the
door, but it was fastened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I am a prisoner;
my rifle and pistol have been taken away in my sleep.
Oh, what, what has happened to Leonard? What can it
all mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hammered at the door, but no answer came. Then
he tried to look out of the window, but it was too high for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
him to be able to see anything through it but the sky.
There was nothing to be done but wait; so he sat down
upon the bed, a picture of misery and bewilderment, and
forthwith began to formulate all sorts of theories and
ideas to account for what had happened to him.</p>

<p>When, after a long interval, the door was opened, a
man entered whose dress showed him to be one of
Coryon&rsquo;s black-tunicked soldiers. He brought in some
food, and a pitcher and a mug, which he deposited upon a
small table, and was turning to go, when Templemore
sprang up and addressed him. He felt so incensed at
the sight of this emissary of Coryon&rsquo;s that he could indeed
scarcely refrain from hurling himself upon him, despite
the fact that the man was armed. But just outside the
door, as he could see, were other soldiers; he could hear,
too, the clank of their arms, so he knew that to attack
the one before him would be worse than useless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>The man, who was just on the point of going out,
turned back for a step or two, and then said in a low
tone,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the prisoner of the High Priest Coryon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how, and why, and where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man shook his head quietly. He was not an ill-favoured
fellow, and regarded his prisoner in a half-friendly
manner, Templemore thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are still in the king&rsquo;s palace,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but
your friend and the princess have been taken away to
Coryon&rsquo;s abode.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Taken away to his place? Great God help them and
help us all, then!&rdquo; Jack moaned, as the picture of what
he had seen there that well-remembered night rose up
before his mind. &ldquo;And how has all this come about?
and where is Monella, and where is the king?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I may not talk to you,&rdquo; the soldier answered. &ldquo;I
have disobeyed orders in telling you thus much. But
Ergalon was a friend of mine and I know that he is a
friend of yours.&rdquo; And he went out, closing and fastening
the door behind him.</p>

<p>Here was terrible news! Leonard and Ulama prisoners
of Coryon; perhaps immured in one of those awful
dungeons within reach of the terrible tree, where the very
sight of what went on beyond those barred and grated
doors was enough to drive the bravest mad; and where,
at any moment, that whistle&mdash;a door run back&mdash;and
then&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too dreadful&mdash;too horrible to think of!&rdquo; Templemore
exclaimed. He sprang up and began pacing restlessly
up and down. &ldquo;I shall go mad myself, if I dwell
upon such thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hours dragged slowly by till evening, when, just
when it was growing dark, the door was once more opened
and the same man came in and, looking at Templemore,
made a sign to be silent. Then he returned to the door
and led in a muffled figure, and, without a word, retired.
The figure threw back a hood that covered the head,
and Templemore, with glad surprise, saw that it was
Zonella.</p>

<p>He ran forward and took her hand in his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zonella!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;This is surprising, and
gladdening too. It does one good to see your face after
all that I have been imagining. Tell me&mdash;what does it
all mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laid her finger on her lips and said in a hushed
voice,</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means that the cunning, treacherous Coryon has
played a trick upon us all, and made you prisoners. Your
friend and our beloved princess have been carried off, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
king himself is kept a prisoner in his room, and so are
many of his ministers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Monella and Ergalon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monella was away in Myrlanda, as you know, and so
has escaped; and Ergalon&mdash;who is free too, but in hiding&mdash;has
sent a trusty messenger to warn him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am virtually a prisoner too. That is, I am forbidden
to leave the palace. But I am free to go about
within it. The whole place is full of Coryon&rsquo;s soldiers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me how it was managed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;loving cup&rsquo; was drugged. All who partook of
it fell into an unnaturally heavy sleep. You remember
almost every one throughout the palace drank some, in
honour of your friend and our poor princess. Alas! alas!
My dear, my loved Ulama!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sobbed bitterly, while Jack marched excitedly up
and down the place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there no hope&mdash;nothing to be done?&rdquo; he exclaimed
despairingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is only one thing,&rdquo; was answered in a low,
hesitating tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come to try to aid you. If you wrap up in
this cloak and go out quietly now, while it is half dark,
you may get clear out of the palace unobserved. One of
my maids is waiting for me without, and will show you
the way. I warned her of my plan, and she is to be
trusted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! And leave you here in my place to suffer
Coryon&rsquo;s vengeance? Why, Zonella&mdash;dear, kind friend&mdash;what
must you think of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can think of nothing else,&rdquo; she answered simply.
&ldquo;And for me&mdash;I care not. Whatever may befall me, <em>you</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
will be able to get away; perhaps even to serve your
friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack took her hand in his, not noticing that she seemed
to shiver under the touch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such an offer is too kind, too much, my dear, good
friend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It cannot be; we must try&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For <em>my</em> sake, then,&rdquo; she exclaimed impulsively. &ldquo;I
would rather die myself than see you carried off to yonder
dens. Or&rdquo;&mdash;she paused confusedly, and then went on&mdash;&ldquo;for
your friend&rsquo;s sake. Think! Consider! Do you
refuse merely from any thought about me? Think what
you might be able to do for others&mdash;for your friend, for
Ulama!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Templemore passed his hand over his face; the tears
were coming into his eyes. When he tried to speak again,
he felt half choking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a noble girl, Zonella,&rdquo; he answered with
emotion; &ldquo;and when you appeal to me on <em>their</em> behalf
you cannot know how hard it is to me to stay on here,
knowing that I have the chance&mdash;just the chance&mdash;of
saving them. But it cannot be, dear friend, it cannot be;
but&mdash;I thank you. My whole heart thanks you.&rdquo; He
pressed her hand, and turned sorrowfully away.</p>

<p>Presently, she spoke again, this time in a different tone;
indeed, her voice sounded hard and strained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Ergalon shall risk his life for you,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I know that which will induce him to attempt what
to-day he said could not be done. I will seek him at once.
For now, good-bye; do not go to bed, but be ready, if
you hear some one at the window. You can reach it, if
you stand up on the table.&rdquo; And, without further explanation,
she left him.</p>

<p>Templemore sat for long pondering upon this strange
interview, and wondering too what she had planned; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the time seemed to drag wearily while he waited for some
signal at the window.</p>

<p>It was about midnight, as he judged, when there came
a tap, tap from the outside. He sprang on to the table;
then by the dim light that came through the window
he could discern the upper part of a man&rsquo;s body swinging
on a rope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that Ergalon?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came back the answer. &ldquo;If I send you in a
short rope and you wait till I have gone down, you can
then pull in the rope I am on, get on to it, and come down
yourself. Do you dare try it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then here it is. Now wait till you find you can pull
this one in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Templemore felt about and caught hold of a small cord
that was hanging inside the window&mdash;which was open to
the air&mdash;and he pulled lightly at it till he felt the strain
upon the rope to which it was attached, relaxed. Then
he pulled harder, and a portion of a thicker rope came inside.
By its means he was able to climb up on to the sill.
With some trouble and man&oelig;uvring he got outside and
was soon sliding down the rope, which Ergalon steadied
from below. It was very dark, and he descended amidst
some trees where it was darker still. When he
touched the ground, at first, he could see nothing; but
Ergalon turned on the light of a bull&rsquo;s-eye lantern. It
was one of those Monella had brought with him, and lent
by him to Ergalon.</p>

<p>A voice, that he knew to be Zonella&rsquo;s, whispered,</p>

<p>&ldquo;That has been well done. Now what do you propose
to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must get down to the canyon by which we came
into the mountain. There we have left spare weapons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
But I can&rsquo;t get down in the dark; not even, I fear, with
the lantern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be a moon later; perhaps that will help.
Let us go in that direction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! you, too?&rdquo; Jack asked in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, why not? I shall be as safe with you as in the
midst of Coryon&rsquo;s hateful minions, and I may be of service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t climb down that place and up again,&rdquo;
Jack reminded her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I can wait near the top, and Ergalon can go with
you to help you carry what you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we shall be a long time, all day to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter, I will manage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the three made their way with much difficulty,
owing to the darkness, to the top of the canyon. Here
they sat and talked in guarded voices till the moon had
risen high enough to light the hazardous descent.</p>

<p>Templemore learned how Coryon&rsquo;s plans had been
carried out; how Ergalon&rsquo;s escape had been due to
his absence from the palace, awaiting the return of
a messenger from Monella. At a late hour, on his way
back to the palace, he had been warned by a friend
amongst Coryon&rsquo;s people. On this he had sent on
the messenger to Monella to inform him of all that had
occurred. The man had been only just in time to get
through the subterranean road before Coryon&rsquo;s soldiers
took possession of it and closed it.</p>

<p>Templemore&rsquo;s escape had been planned by Zonella.
She had smuggled Ergalon into the palace and up to the
roof disguised as one of her own maids; and in this she
had been aided by one of his friends amongst the soldiers
of the priest. Ergalon had at first objected strongly, conceiving
that the attempt was foolhardy and could not
succeed; that he would only lose his own liberty and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
perhaps, his life, and that Monella might be displeased.
In short, he had considered himself bound to do nothing
that was in any way risky until Monella had communicated
with him. But Zonella had contrived, by some means, to
persuade him; and had herself stolen out and steadied the
rope for Ergalon in his perilous descent.</p>

<p>From his friend in the opposite camp Ergalon had learned
one very important thing&mdash;that nothing was likely to be
done to Leonard or Ulama till the day that had been named
for their betrothal. That day Coryon had fixed upon, with
cruel irony, for the holding of a sort of trial, the result of
which would be a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; said Ergalon, &ldquo;if you can get back by the
morning of to-morrow&rdquo; (it being then already morning)
&ldquo;you will be in time; though I fear you will find it
difficult to effect much good alone, and I cannot yet tell
when the lord Monella may be able to get through the
subterranean passage to come to your assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will try, anyhow,&rdquo; said Jack, setting his teeth with
grim determination. &ldquo;And, if I fail, we will die together.
One can but die once. I think it is possible to get back
with a couple of rifles and pistols and the necessary
ammunition by the morning. If human effort can do it,
it shall be done; and I can then put a pistol into your
hands, too, my good friend.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.<br />

<span class="f8">&lsquo;IN THE DEVIL-TREE&rsquo;S LARDER!&rsquo;</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Leonard</span> awoke from a deep sleep, on the morning
after the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i>, to find himself, like Templemore, in a
place that was strange to him.</p>

<p>So profound had been the slumber induced by the drug
that had been mixed with the drink, that he had been
carried all the way to Coryon&rsquo;s retreat in absolute unconsciousness.
When he at last woke up, he was in one of
the cells under the terrace within the reach of the great
flesh-eating tree.</p>

<p>No words can describe the horror and anguish that
filled his breast when, by degrees, he realised the dreadful
truth. Not only did he shudder at the thought of his own
too probable fate, but the fear that his sweet Ulama might
share the same awful doom drove him almost to the verge
of madness. He cursed the false sense of security that
had led up to this terrible result. A few simple precautions
would have frustrated this treachery! But it
was too late!</p>

<p>Through the grated door he could see the great devil-tree,
hear the swishing of its long, trailing branches,
watch them come up to the grating and search about over
its face for some opening large enough to penetrate, even
trying to wriggle in through its small slits and perforations.
In the centre of the cell was a block of wood fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
in the ground to serve as a table. A small stream of water
ran down from a pipe above and fell into a channel in the
floor, and a pitcher stood beside it. For chair there was
a smaller log of wood; the &lsquo;bed&rsquo; on which he had found
himself was simply a bag of straw whereon were laid two
or three rugs. An iron door shut off the back from an
interior gallery, and the cell was partitioned off from
others, on each side, by grated screens, like that in the
front. The occupants of adjacent cells could, therefore,
see each other.</p>

<p>As Leonard looked round in astonishment and alarm,
and exclaimed, involuntarily, &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; a discordant
peal of mocking laughter rang out from the cell
upon his right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he! He doesn&rsquo;t even know where he is!&rdquo;
a harsh voice cried out. &ldquo;He&mdash;one of the gods that
wielded the lightning and thunder! After all, caught by
Coryon, and brought here like the rest of us! Ha! ha!
ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard, shocked and amazed, went to the side whence
the sounds proceeded, and there saw, peering through the
bars, a horrible face that grinned at him with hideous sneers
and wild-looking eyes. The hair and beard were matted
and dishevelled; the face and figure, so far as he could
make them out, looked gaunt and thin. He was dressed
in the black tunic with gold star that denoted one of
Coryon&rsquo;s soldiers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed the mocking voice. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t know where you are, eh? I&rsquo;ll tell you, my lord,
son of the gods, that can kill us soldiers with a magic
lightning wand, but can&rsquo;t keep yourself out of Coryon&rsquo;s
clutches&mdash;you are in the &lsquo;devil-tree&rsquo;s larder&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil-tree&rsquo;s larder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord; the devil-tree&rsquo;s larder. That means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
that they have put you here to keep you cool and in good
condition, before they hand you over to be food for their
pet out there.&rdquo; And he pointed to the tree.</p>

<p>Leonard shuddered, and the awful truth of the man&rsquo;s
statement forced itself upon his mind, in spite of his wish
to believe it too atrocious to be possible. He went up to
the door in the front and examined it. He saw that it
ran in grooves at the top and bottom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the mocking voice behind him, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
right. You see how it&rsquo;s done now. They run that back
from inside, sudden-like, some time when you don&rsquo;t expect
it; and in come the twisting branches that lay hold of
you, and out you go to make him a nice meal. Ha! ha!
ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard turned and stared in helpless horror. Was
it possible that there was such cold-blooded, fiendish
cruelty in the world? Yet&mdash;he remembered the fate of
the poor puma. He trembled, and turned sick and faint;
while the one in the next cell continued to jeer and mock
at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your lightning-wand, my lord? Why have
you not brought it to try it on the tree? You managed
to get <em>me</em> brought here; and now you&rsquo;ve managed to get
here yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got <em>you</em> brought here? How? What then are
you doing here?&rdquo; Leonard asked, his surprise overcoming
his disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I doing here? Why, the same as you&mdash;waiting
in &lsquo;the devil-tree&rsquo;s larder&rsquo; till I&rsquo;m given to him
for a meal&mdash;as you will be. And it&rsquo;s all through you;
because you killed some of us and we others ran away;
this is what they do with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard shuddered again, while the man went to the
stream of water that, as in Leonard&rsquo;s cell, was pouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
down from a pipe above, and, filling the pitcher, took a
long drink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makes you thirsty, this sort of thing,&rdquo; he said, with
another jeering laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find that water there
mighty handy if they let you stay here long enough. Ha!
ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man was evidently in a state of high fever. The
place was full of f&oelig;tid odours given off by the foul tree;
and, apart from that, the want of sleep would superinduce
fever, if, indeed, it did not drive mad the wretched occupants
of the cells; for who could sleep for more than a
minute or two at a time in one of those dens, where, at
any moment, the door might be run back and the miserable
prisoner delivered over to the fatal branches? It was
this constant, ever-present dread that banished sleep,
and must inevitably end in madness for the victims,
provided they were kept there long enough.</p>

<p>Then the thought flashed upon him that Ulama also
might be an occupant of one of these awful cells; and at
that such a burst of grief and agony came over him that
he hid his face within his hands and groaned aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yah! don&rsquo;t give way like that, my lord. Being here&rsquo;s
not so bad when once you&rsquo;re used to it! Look at me!
You don&rsquo;t see me worry and cry like a great girl. I take
it quietly; I&rsquo;ve been too used to seeing others here.
Many&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve had the pulling back of these doors
and have seen a man or a woman hauled out squealing
and kicking like an animal going to be killed; and I&rsquo;ve
laughed at them. I thought it such fun! And now those
who used to help me and laugh with me, they&rsquo;re waiting
to see how I like it; and they will laugh at me, too, just
the same. But I don&rsquo;t care. What does it matter? It&rsquo;s
nothing, I tell you, when you&rsquo;re as used to it as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wretched creature thus trying to delude himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
with boastful talk and jeering at his fellow-captive, was
himself, it was easy to see, worked up into the highest
state of nervous dread and fear. The least sound made
him start and look with straining eyeballs in the direction
from which it came. He kept going to the pitcher for
draughts of water, and never remained still for a single
instant. If he sat down for a short space, the twitching of
a foot, or leg, or hand, spoke of agitation within that
would not be controlled.</p>

<p>Leonard turned from the sight with mingled feelings of
disgust and loathing and, going to the other side, looked
through the grating of the adjoining cell, to see whether it
was occupied. And, looking, his heart seemed to come
up into his throat when he saw a silent female form
seated with its back to him. The exclamation that
escaped him caused the form to turn, when he saw that
the woman was a stranger. Her face was pleasing in its
features, and good-looking, but had in its expression such a
burden of unspeakable horror and despair that he shivered
as he met her glance. At sight of it, for the moment, he
almost forgot his own misery, and he asked gently,</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who then are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a few seconds there was no reply; then, in a voice
that had in it the suggestion of much sweetness, albeit
now forced, and unnatural,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know. Once I was a happy young girl;
then a well-beloved and loving wife and mother; now
I am only something with which to feed yonder monster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the woman dreamily, &ldquo;I was once
good-looking, they said. Certainly, my husband thought
so; and that was enough for me. But it was my curse,
alas! for Skelda, the chief of the priests next to Coryon,
thought so too. He stole me away from my home and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
my children and forced me to become one of his so-called
wives. And now, because my sorrowing and
pining have seared and furrowed my good looks, even
as they had eaten into my heart, he has tired of me,
and has sent me to the fate that, sooner or later, we all
come to here&mdash;all of my sex, at least, as well as many
of the other among those who are not priests. Yet,&rdquo;
she added, &ldquo;it is but five years since they brought
me here. What I look like now you can see for yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard looked at her with pity; and there came into
his mind the remembrance of Ulama&rsquo;s words of the day
before&mdash;&ldquo;It seems almost wrong to be happy when I know
so many others are unhappy&rdquo;&mdash;and his own light rejoinder.
And he reproached himself in that he had been
content to bask in love and self-enjoyment while, close
at hand, there were such abuses, such direful sufferings.
True, he had not actually known their whole nature and
extent; but he <em>had</em> known of the so-called &lsquo;blood-tax&rsquo;;
and had heard enough to make it certain, had he given
the matter due consideration, that there were evils in the
land that cried aloud for remedy.</p>

<p>Then his thoughts reverted to Ulama, and he asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know aught concerning the Princess
Ulama?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that she was to be brought to this place,
and that she was to be put into the cell I occupied before
they brought me here yesterday. It is underground;
a long way from this part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At least, then, the poor child, Leonard thankfully
reflected, was not in one of the cells in sight of the
dreaded tree.</p>

<p>Presently he asked the woman whether she had known
Zelus, the son of Coryon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah yes! Who did not in this land?&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;The monster! A great spasm as of relief and
joy came upon us all&mdash;all the women, I mean&mdash;when we
heard of his death. He was the worst of them all,
though one of the youngest. No one was safe from
him. Even the princess he sought to bring here to
treat as he had treated so many others!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. I killed him when he was in the very act
of raising his cowardly hand against the king&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo;
said Leonard quietly.</p>

<p>The woman turned and looked at him with more of
interest in her manner than she had yet shown. She
scanned him closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must be one of the strangers
of whom we heard. But you are young, and not, as I
have been told, of our race. We heard of one older,
one who, it was said, belonged to our people. And
when we heard that, we all rejoiced; for surely, we said,
he brings us tidings of what all have been expecting.
Therefore, we who were held here in a bondage that
is a daily, hourly torture, a never-ceasing degradation,
we welcomed your coming as a sign that the Great Spirit
had at last brought our long punishment to an end.
I, even I, dared to hope I should escape the fate that
has befallen all others, and should live to see again my
husband and children before I die. But, alas! it was but
a dream&mdash;a delusive, passing hope, a thing too good to
come in my time. Four months have passed and nothing
has occurred, though ye smote the hated Zelus quickly;
and even Coryon was filled with fear and dread. Why
have ye failed to do more, and, instead, fallen victim to
Coryon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah! why? It was a question that now sank deep into
Leonard&rsquo;s soul and tortured him with vain regrets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
self-reproach. For he had a heart that swelled with
kindness towards his fellows, and a tender conscience;
and the more he thought things over, the more difficult
he found it to feel that he was without blame. He had
been too selfishly wrapped up in his own personal feelings,
he now acknowledged; too little interested in those very
matters that, as the king&rsquo;s future son-in-law, should have
taken, if not the first, at least a prominent position in his
mind. And then, to be ignobly trapped, at a time when
there was nothing but feasting and amusement in their
minds! Their arms taken from them&mdash;they who could
have kept at bay all Coryon&rsquo;s soldiers and dispersed them,
had they but been vigilant and wakeful! It was a cruelly
humiliating thought&mdash;it was worse; for the child-hearted,
innocent Ulama, who had a right to rely on his protection,
had been sacrificed also to his self-abandonment and want
of watchfulness.</p>

<p>Thus did Leonard reason, now that his opportunities
had vanished. He knew not what was the true explanation
of the position in which he found himself; but a
vague, half-formed idea crept into his mind that Coryon
would hardly have ventured upon such a daring stroke
unless he had felt he could rely upon the support, or, at
least, the indifferent neutrality, of a certain proportion of
the people. And if he, Leonard, had shown more interest
in the affairs of the people over whom he was one day to
be king, he might have gained so firm a hold on their
confidence and affections as would have rendered Coryon&rsquo;s
schemes hopeless from the very start.</p>

<p>But such thoughts, whether well or ill-founded, came
now all too late. Here he was, caged, and at Coryon&rsquo;s
mercy. His relentless enemy had but to give the signal
and he would be consigned to an awful death.</p>

<p>He had some further talk with the woman, who told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
him terrible tales of indescribable barbarities and iniquities
perpetrated by the priestly tyrants under the
covering of their &lsquo;religion&rsquo;; tales that made the blood
within him boil, and filled his soul with savage, though
helpless, indignation. Then he asked the woman&rsquo;s name,
and was told it was Fernina.</p>

<p>At last, he asked the question that, though often upon
his tongue, yet he had shrunk from giving voice to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do you suppose will happen&mdash;here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sighed and shook her head, hopelessly, despairingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only what always happens,&rdquo; she answered, in a dull,
listless tone. &ldquo;None that are once placed here ever
escape the fatal tree; except that sometimes they are
carried up above and laid on what they call &lsquo;the devil-tree&rsquo;s
ladle.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The devil-tree&rsquo;s ladle?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; it is a contrivance on wheels; a kind of long
plank shaped at one end like a great spoon. Those who
are to be given to the tree are laid upon it, bound so that
they cannot move, and then pushed out along the stone-work
till they are within reach of the branches; those
who push the plank at the other end being far enough
away for their own safety. It is part of the system of
terrorism and torture here,&rdquo; Fernina added, &ldquo;to place
some of us, at times, in rooms that are in the rock above,
and that overlook this place, and to keep us locked in
there for days and nights, that we may be cowed and
frightened at the scenes that are enacted here. Often, a
hateful fascination compels you to become an unwilling
witness; in any case, you cannot avoid hearing the
shrieks and moans; imagination supplies the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard turned away, not caring to hear more, and sat
down to brood, eating his heart out with keen regrets, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
now unavailing. The jeering of the half-mad wretch in
the other cell had ceased; he, too, had fallen into a sort
of brooding lethargy, and so was quiet; but a constant
tap, tap, tap, of one foot on the stone floor told he was
not asleep. Thus the hours dragged by in silence, save
for the intermittent, stealthy rustle of the branches outside,
as they came prowling over the face of the gratings
in their sleepless seeking after the prey they seemed to
scent within.</p>

<p>Once, a small grating at the bottom of the door of each
cell was opened, and a platter with coarse food upon it
was pushed in; then the space closed up again. The
sounds made them all, for the moment, start; then they
relapsed again into the stupor of despair. None touched
the food or even noticed it. But the man in the further
cell had now seated himself near the little stream of water
and, every now and then, he roused himself to take long
draughts.</p>

<p>When it grew dark, a lighted lantern was pushed under
the door into each cell, as the food had been. Leonard
felt drowsy and longed for rest; yet was afraid to lie
down or to close his eyes. Now and again they even
closed against his will in a short doze; but it was never
of long duration, and each time he woke it was with a
renewed sense of the horror of his situation.</p>

<p>He had just roused from one of these brief snatches of
sleep, and had had time to remember once more where
he was, when a low rumble made him spring up and look
around. Then the man in the next cell gave an awful
cry&mdash;a cry that rang in Leonard&rsquo;s ears for many a day&mdash;and
at the same moment the grated door of his prison
slowly began to move. In his demented terror he banged
himself against the partition between the two cells, tried
to get his fingers into the slits that he might cling to it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
then climbed up on to the wooden block in the middle of
the cell. But the rustling branches neared him, sought
for him on every side, and soon mounted the log and
caught him in their deadly embrace. Slowly, but irresistibly,
while he never ceased his cries or his vain
struggles and clutchings, the coils around him tightened
and dragged him out into the darkness, where his cries
gradually became weaker, and were finally heard no
more; and when they ceased, and he heard the door
rolling back, with dull rumbling, to its place, Leonard
tottered to the pile of rugs in the corner of his cell, and
fell upon them in a swoon.</p>

<p>When he returned to consciousness a bright light was
shining through the grated door. He got up and, like one
who is but a helpless on-looker in a fevered dream, he
went to the bars and gazed out. It was bright moonlight
outside, and there he saw the same ghastly scene repeated
that Templemore had witnessed a short time before. He
saw the dead body of the latest victim of the tree&rsquo;s insatiable
thirst for blood dangling amongst the branches; caught
up, now by the neck, and now by the feet, and passed on
from one branch to another in what seemed a new dance
or sport of death; and finally carried off by the great
crawling reptiles that had come up to claim their share in
the repast.</p>

<p>While the scene lasted, Leonard seemed incapable of
volition; his limbs refused to obey the will of his reeling
brain and to bear him away from the sight. But, when the
creatures had disappeared, he turned and made his way
once more to the low bed, where he remained in a state of
torpor till the day was far advanced.</p>

<p>After what seemed a long interval, he sat up and rubbed
his eyes, after the manner of one just awakened from the
horror of a nightmare. Then he saw the woman who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
occupied the next cell standing with her eyes fixed on
him; and, when she found he was once more awake and
conscious, she addressed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Even in my own
misery I am not so blinded but that I can see that your
burden of sorrow is a heavy one&mdash;more than you can bear.
Yet methinks, were I a man, I would not thus give way to
it. I am but a woman, but my greatest wish&mdash;since nothing
else is left me&mdash;is that I may see Coryon once more&mdash;stand
face to face with him&mdash;and show him that all his
calculated cruelty and subtle ingenuity of torture have not
subdued my spirit, nor the scorn that a heart conscious of
having done no wrong can feel for such as he. I would
give him back look for look, hate for hate, as I have before
to-day; and make his wicked eyes quail before mine with
the consciousness that the spirit of one he has unjustly
oppressed can show itself greater than his own. But with
<em>you</em>&mdash;he will but laugh at you&mdash;for I feel, somehow, you
will be taken from here to meet him. I suspect he has sent
you here first to crush your spirit with the sight of the
horrors that are perpetrated here. He&mdash;have you ever
seen him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Leonard answered, staring at her in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! then you know not what he is like. I tell you,&rdquo;
the strange woman went on, her eyes lighting up with
unexpected fire, &ldquo;he is a man whose mere glance strikes
terror into the souls of ordinary men. There is that about
him that makes you shrink as from some unearthly incarnation
of all the powers of evil; and in that he delights,
yea, more, even, than in torturing his victims.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here she broke off abruptly; then resumed, in a different
manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been wondering whether you are he who was
to have wedded the princess?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! yes. You have divined aright,&rdquo; Leonard
answered sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the woman, with increasing warmth, that
gained as she went on an energy that was almost fierceness,
&ldquo;then, the greater the reason you should throw off
this weakness and gird up your strength to meet the
haughty tyrant and show him that your spirit is equal to
his own. In all his ill-spent time upon this earth&mdash;and
they say it has been a very long one&mdash;it is his boast and
his pride that scarce any can meet his glance without
quailing under it. Think! Think how he will triumph
over you&mdash;how he will point the finger of scorn&mdash;turn the
look of cold contempt upon the one who aspired to be the
future king of this country&mdash;and <em>that</em> means to stand on
an equality with himself&mdash;and yet, as he will declare, is
but a weak, puling, or ordinary mortal. Ah! would I
were in your place! You can but die. But I would make
him feel that I had a heart, a spirit, more dauntless, more
unconquerable than his own. Ay! I would die knowing
that for many and many and many a year to come, the
remembrance that he had met <em>one</em> spirit he could not
intimidate or master would be to him an instrument of
defeat and shame, eating into his proud heart, even as
the suffering he has caused to me has gnawed into my
own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman spoke at the last with a force that almost
electrified her hearer. Leonard felt roused as, perhaps
he had never been roused before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right, my friend!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;and I
thank you. As you truly say, he who aspires to high
things should show himself worthy to achieve them, and
not even the shadow of a dreadful death and cruel
sufferings should have the strength to cow his spirit in
the presence of this most cold-blooded and revolting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
tyrant. If I have shown weakness, it was not from personal
fear, but from thought of the suffering of one dearly
loved, and my self-reproach for having been the unintentional
cause of it. It is well that I met you; for you
have taught me how I should meet this Coryon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;if you want one unerring
shaft to launch at him&mdash;one that I know will pierce the
armour of his pride and drive him to the verge of madness&mdash;tell
him you know one woman whose spirit more
than matches his; tell him that she is called Fernina.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<span class="f8">CORYON.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">At</span> sunrise on the morning of the day that was to
have witnessed Leonard&rsquo;s public betrothal he was
sitting staring gloomily, through the grating of his cell, at
the never-resting branches without, when the sounds of
drums, on which a long tattoo was being beaten, broke on
his ear. The sounds came from both near and far, some
half-muffled in the galleries and caverns of the cliff, others
echoing from one side to the other of the rocky enclosure
till they died away in the far distance.</p>

<p>Since the previous morning nothing further had occurred;
the woman was still in the cell on one side of
him; no new victim had been brought to occupy the
other.</p>

<p>The roll of the drums caused Leonard to start up and
look about him. He was haggard and worn from want
of sleep, but his step was firm, and his face was stamped
with a look of quiet resolution that showed he had taken
to heart his fellow-prisoner&rsquo;s advice. When he rose up she
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is as I thought,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;they are to have one of
their gatherings to-day, when the tree will be given its
meal in sight of all who are summoned to be present.
That is why one of us was not given to it last night, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
doubt.&rdquo; And she gave a short, hard laugh, that was far
from pleasant to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt it is your turn,&rdquo; she went on in a softer
tone. &ldquo;You must summon all your fortitude. Be brave!
If one must die, one needs not show such craven fear as
that half-mad wretch exhibited the other night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak well, my good friend, and what you have
said to me has braced me up. Would that, before we
part, I could say or do something to serve or comfort
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That cannot be; only remember what I told you&mdash;if
you want a taunt to hurl at the tyrant&rsquo;s head, a taunt
that will stab him through his self-admiration, you know
now what to say. Soon they will be here for you. Ah!&rdquo;
here she broke off, as though a new thought had come to
her. &ldquo;On these days they are all assembled outside&mdash;all
the men. Only the women and children are left within
their dens. Oh, if I could but get free for half an hour!
I know some of their secrets, and could play a trick upon
them that would go far to square accounts between us.
But, of course,&rdquo; she added mournfully, &ldquo;it is foolishness
to think of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Overhead could now be heard the scuffling of many
footsteps, and, anon, more drum-beating, with much
blowing of horns and trumpets. Next, there were shouting
and cheering, followed by what appeared to be a speech
from some one; but the words were not intelligible to the
two anxious listeners.</p>

<p>At one time the noise had brought a faint hope into
Leonard&rsquo;s mind that it might portend the approach of
friends; but the words Fernina had just spoken quickly
dissipated any such idea.</p>

<p>Presently, steps were heard in the gallery outside,
a key was inserted in the lock, and two of Coryon&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
black-coated soldiers entered. They were both armed
with drawn swords; and one of them, addressing Leonard
in gruff accents, said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to come with us.&rdquo; Then, turning to his
comrade, he asked, &ldquo;Have you the cord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;I thought you had it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I thought you were bringing it. Go, get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man went out.</p>

<p>Then he who had remained, raising a warning hand to
Leonard, addressed him in low, guarded tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lord Monella,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is hastening to thine aid
with many armed followers; but he has been detained
in the underground pass. Whether he will arrive in
time, I know not; if not and thou be harmed, thou wilt be
avenged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who art thou, then?&rdquo; asked Leonard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A friend of the lord Monella&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my other friend&mdash;what of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a prisoner, but escaped, and has gone&mdash;I
know not whither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven be praised for that! Ah, I can guess where
he has gone!&rdquo; Just then a sudden thought came into
Leonard&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, friend,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;canst thou not turn
the key in the lock of the next cell and give the poor
creature there one little chance for liberty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know, but I will see. If the key fits, I
might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick, then, ere thy fellow returns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man hastily took out the key and tried it in the
lock of the woman&rsquo;s cell; it fitted, and he unlocked the
door; then withdrawing the key, he replaced it in the
door of Leonard&rsquo;s cell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roll that log to the door to keep it close till you think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
it safe to venture out,&rdquo; Leonard advised the woman. She
had but just done so when they heard the steps of the
other soldier in the gallery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is thy name, friend?&rdquo; Leonard asked him in a
whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Melta,&rdquo; the man answered; and then, when the other
made his appearance with some cord, he began to rate
him for having been so long.</p>

<p>Leonard was bound in a loose fashion, just sufficient
to prevent his free use of either arms or legs, and led
away. On his way out he said a kindly word to Fernina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Spirit help you,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I have
no fear for you now; you will die with courage, if
it be so fated. A heart that can feel and think for
a stranger in the midst of such distress as is yours
to-day is the heart of a brave man. But we may yet
meet again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no false hopes,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I do not
expect that help can now come in time. I may be avenged;
that is the most I can hope for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said the woman in a meaning tone; &ldquo;you
will be avenged; and so shall I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who had been sent for the cord laughed
jeeringly at the woman when she said this, but took no
further notice of her; and the three proceeded along the
gallery till they came to some steps at the end. Ascending
these they entered a broader gallery or corridor
above; then, turning back, they passed out through the
gateway and along the covered-way, finally emerging on the
main terrace of the great amphitheatre.</p>

<p>Round the sides of the enclosure a large number of
people were gathered. Among these were black-coated
soldiers to the number of, perhaps, two hundred; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
others, of whom there were from four to five hundred,
also carried arms of some sort, spears or swords. When
Leonard cast his eyes around and noted them, the heart
within him sank, for he saw how difficult would be a
rescue, even with the armed followers that the man Melta
had said accompanied Monella.</p>

<p>In the centre of the great terrace, upon a high chair
carved and emblazoned, and with a great banner waving
above his head, sat the dreaded Coryon. Round him
were grouped, first his nine priests in black robes, and
Dakla and others of his chief officers; then, ranks of
soldiers and, among them, some of the king&rsquo;s ministers
and chief functionaries, all bound as Leonard was. But
the king himself was not there; nor was Ulama; and
Leonard, when he had assured himself of this, turned
his gaze on Coryon.</p>

<p>It was well that he had been warned that he would
need all his courage to enable him to look upon this man
unflinchingly. Even thus prepared he found it barely
possible to keep down the emotion the sight excited in his
breast.</p>

<p>He saw before him a man of great height and powerful
frame, clad in a black robe with a star on the breast
worked in virgin gold and set with jewels. His grey
hair and beard were unkempt and long, his skin of a dark
swarthy hue, his forehead, albeit broad, was receding, and
furrowed, and wrinkled into a sinister scowl, and his lips
were parted or drawn up in a set snarl that disclosed
teeth more like a wild beast&rsquo;s fangs than a human being&rsquo;s
teeth. When Leonard first caught sight of him, he was
standing with one arm extended as though he had just
finished some harangue; but, when Leonard was brought
up, Coryon sat down. Then he slowly turned his glance
upon the prisoner.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill07"></a>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>And beneath that glance a feeling of cold horror stole
into Leonard&rsquo;s breast; he felt as though an icy hand were
about to seize his very heart and wring it in a grip of iron.
It was the nameless dread that a man may feel in the
presence of something that his instincts tell him is a
deadly enemy, yet of which he cannot discover the form,
or size, or nature; whether earthly or supernatural.
Here, certainly, the outward shape was that of a man,
but in the eyes there was something suggesting that
their owner was not a man at all, but a living incarnation
of depravity&mdash;a demon with eyes, for the moment quiescent
as with the cold glitter and deadly malignancy of the
serpent, but instinct with suppressed power, and ready
to flame up with terrible, relentless, overwhelming energy.
Mingled with the snake-like glitter of malevolence there
were lurid flashes that darted forth perpetually, causing
the beholder to recoil as though from actual darts. At
sight of him one thought of some nameless monster
coiled up and meditating a spring upon its prey; a
monster that was the implacable foe of the whole human
race, that embodied, in human form, all the power, the
attributes, the cruelty, of an arch-demon from another
world.</p>

<p>From such a being the soul shrinks with a horror
that is less earthly fear than the natural loathing of
evil things that is implanted within the breasts of all
endowed with pure and holy instincts; and this was
Leonard&rsquo;s feeling while he stood, half sick and faint,
enduring and returning Coryon&rsquo;s fixed look.</p>

<p>But just when it came upon him that he must either
shift his glance or drop helpless to the ground, the
thought of all the child-like, innocent Ulama must have
suffered through the shameless treachery of this fiend
in human shape came into his mind; and, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
thought, forth from his heart rushed out the blood,
bursting through the icy grip that had all but closed
upon it, and coursing through his veins in a leaping
torrent, like one of those great waves of fiery indignation
that sometimes, for a while, gives to one man the strength
of ten. With a sudden impulse that forgot everything
but his righteous anger, he put forth such an effort that
he broke the cords that bound him; then, rushing impetuously
upon Coryon, before any one could interfere,
he actually had him by the throat in a clutch that, spite
of the other&rsquo;s own gigantic strength, would have ended
his vile life if, for a few seconds longer, his assailant
had been left alone. But a dozen hands laid hold of
him and pulled him back, bruised and panting, to the
custody of the men he had escaped from. But, though
baffled and injured in the struggle, there was in his eyes
a light almost of triumph when he turned round and faced
his enemy once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Coward! Hateful murderer
of women and children and unarmed men! Thou darest
not come down and meet me man to man! Though thou
art near twice my size, I had choked the foul life out of
thee, had we been left alone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first, Coryon made no answer, except to glare at his
late assailant with his evil eyes; but they fell away under
the other&rsquo;s dauntless look, and he put his hands to his
throat as if in pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will cost thee dear,&rdquo; at last he said, in a harsh,
croaking voice; but Leonard replied with a cold smile,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou canst but kill me; and I would not beg mercy
from such as thou. Why dost turn thine eyes away,
coward Coryon? Dost feel at last that so foul a thing
may not endure the glance of an honest man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coryon sprang up and stood for a moment with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
hands extended towards his prisoner, his fingers closing
and opening convulsively as though he half intended to
accept the challenge in the other&rsquo;s words and looks.
Then he managed to control his passion and sat down
again, first addressing a few words in a low tone to a
priest who stood beside him.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

<span class="f8">ON THE &lsquo;DEVIL-TREE&rsquo;S LADLE!&rsquo;</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> Coryon sat down, a kind of buzzing or hum
or talk in low tones broke out on all sides.
Exclamations and expressions of astonishment were
heard, for never had such audacity been known in a
prisoner standing thus on the very brink of death and
almost within reach of the clutch of the fatal tree.</p>

<p>Leonard was now bound again, and Dakla sent two or
three of his subordinate officers to stand beside him.
But, even while they bound him, the guards, as he could
hardly fail to see, treated him with a measure of involuntary
respect; and well they might, for there was
not one amongst them that durst look the evil Coryon
in the face.</p>

<p>Then was brought out the contrivance called the
&lsquo;devil-tree&rsquo;s ladle&rsquo;; it was simply a long plank widened
out at one end, and mounted, in the centre, on wheels.
An irrepressible shudder passed through Leonard when
he saw this grim apparatus. But there was little outward
sign of his emotion, and his eyes were soon again
fixed on Coryon, who rose and thus addressed those
present,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friends, ye all see here a confirmation of that which
I have already explained unto you this morning. Yonder
stands one of the strangers whom the king hath admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
to his friendship; the man he was about to honour
by alliance with his royal house. Ye can see for yourselves
the untutored passions by which this youth, who
was, forsooth, to have been your future king, is swayed,
and his lack of seemly behaviour in the presence of one
like myself, who hath for so many years held a high
position in the land, and hath conferred so many benefits
upon it. Not the least of these, my friends, is that which
I have just achieved&mdash;only just in time. I have, with the
joint help of those powerful gods whom we all here serve,
been able to defeat and overcome even the magic with
which these men were armed. Ye all know, or have
heard, how they came provided, by some enemies of our
race outside the country, with magic wands that brought
down lightning and thunder and death upon those
opposed to them; and to their seeming power the king
weakly yielded, and allowed these strangers to assume
high stations in the land. Zelus, my well-beloved son,
early fell a victim to their lawless intrusion into our
domains, as did many of my people whom I sent to
capture them. But in the end I have prevailed against
them; I have taken from them their magic wands, and
now they are, as ye all can see, but ordinary men. But
a punishment hath fallen upon the king, for he is sick
to death, and that is why he is not here to-day. He
hath not long to live, and soon the country will be without
a king. Now it seemeth to me certain that the people
are averse from accepting this young stranger as the
successor to their dying ruler, and that they desire one
of their own race. This hath caused me much anxious
thought, but I have at last, I think, discovered a solution
of the difficulty. <em>I</em> will espouse the Princess Ulama,
and become the king&rsquo;s son-in-law; thus will your minds
be set at rest; for ye will know that whenever the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
dieth he will be succeeded by a ruler who is not only of
your own race, but hath served his country long enough
to satisfy all objectors as to his experience, or his ability,
or his solicitude for the welfare of his native land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While uttering these words, Coryon looked with a
hardly-veiled smile of malice at Leonard, who, listening
to the infamous proposal wrapped up in such unblushing
hypocrisy, started as though he would have rushed again
upon the speaker; but he was held too firmly by those
who now surrounded him. He could scarce keep from
groaning aloud at what he had just heard.</p>

<p>Coryon marked with evident satisfaction this effect of
his announcement, and proceeded, in an unctuous voice,
and with an affectation of great resignation,</p>

<p>&ldquo;In doing this, good friends, I have, I assure you, no
thought, no feeling save the welfare of my country. I had
not thought ever to take to me another wife; though I
had looked with favour upon the desire of my son Zelus
to ally himself with our king&rsquo;s daughter. But, since this
young stranger hath rendered that impossible by slaying
treacherously mine only son, I will accept the necessities of
the situation, and sacrifice my own feelings for the general
good. Perhaps, after all, it is as well; for in me ye will
have, as ye all know well, one who thinks always only of
his people&rsquo;s weal. For long ages I have guarded the land
from outward foes by making friends of the powers of
darkness. This, and this alone hath protected us from
invasion by the hordes of wild men that we know exist
beyond our borders. The powers, whose High Priest I
am, have guarded us through many centuries, and have
planted around the limits of our island a forest impenetrable
and filled with terrible creatures for our protection.
True, they let these strangers through, but only as a
warning of that which might befall if we forgot, even for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
a moment, our religion, or rebelled against the sacrifices
it requires and that our gods look for from us and will
insist upon. True, we have to sacrifice some of those we
love to our sacred tree, but what is that compared with the
benefits and advantages that the rest receive? We have
peace, prosperity, contentment, freedom from invasion,
from wars, from enemies and dangers of all kinds; and,
compared with these, the price that hath to be paid is, after
all, but small. Henceforth, too, there will be a stronger
guarantee for peace throughout the land, in that your
king and the head of your religion will be one. And you,
my faithful followers, who have served me well,&rdquo; continued
the arch-hypocrite, casting his eyes around, &ldquo;will no more
be called upon to reside in the rocky fastness that has been
so long our home; for I shall take up my abode in the
palace of the king and there shall ye all follow me.&rdquo; At this
a loud cheer went up from all. &ldquo;And now to more
immediate duties. I have condemned this murderer of
my son to death; he shall end his life befittingly as a
sacrifice to the gods whose power he hath defied in coming
here&mdash;defied only to his own doom. So shall perish all
who brave me; and so shall perish this man&rsquo;s friends, his
murderous abettors who, too, are in my power. And now,
sirrah, if thou hast aught to say, thou hast just a minute.
If thou hast aught to ask me, now is thy final opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he ceased speaking, Coryon sat down, first
casting at Leonard a hideous glance of triumph. Leonard
saw the sneer and knew that his enemy&rsquo;s desire was to
excite him to a farther display of useless anger; but the
knowledge only served to calm him, and, when he spoke, it
was in a voice that had in it neither bitterness nor passion,
but only a great sadness. He did not wish to gratify
Coryon by exhibiting anger; and thus he spoke,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true I have something I would say, but it is not
to thee, O Coryon, but to those who are not Coryon&rsquo;s degraded
servants, but free agents, who have been misled into
supporting him here to-day. To you, good people, I
address myself.&rdquo; And Leonard cast his eyes around upon
those who were not wearers of Coryon&rsquo;s uniform. &ldquo;I have
much to say and much to ask. Know that the power of
this boastful tyrant who declares with mock humility his
wicked purpose to force the youthful daughter of his king
into an alliance that revolts her&mdash;know, good people, that
his power is almost at an end, and that he will never enter
into that palace, in which he has promised to find place
for his credulous followers. He may kill me if he will,
but my death will naught avail; a few hours hence he
will be either a prisoner in the hands of those who came
with me, or hiding in his underground haunts like a
hunted animal that dares not show its face above the
ground. But the end will be the same. He will quickly
be hurled out, and a terrible punishment will be meted
out to him and to all those who abet him&mdash;every one, that
is, who shall support him. Therefore I say this to you,
when my friends come&mdash;as come they will&mdash;do not help
Coryon&rsquo;s myrmidons against them. They will come armed
with a fearful power that you can scarce conceive; you
shall see the very rocks fall away before them in crashing
thunders as they hunt these rats out of their holes. If
you fight on Coryon&rsquo;s side, they will mow you down like
grass before the scythe. On the other hand, if you side
not with these doomed ones, but, instead, ask for mercy,
you shall find it; for we came not to this land to teach
cruelty and murder, but to deliver it from the tyranny that
has so long oppressed it. That is my advice to you; what
I would ask is that you tell your fellow-citizens that I am
sore distressed in that I have done far less than I might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
to win their affections and their confidence. That I have
made a terrible mistake, that it has led me to this situation,
I now see. But my error I shall expiate with my life;
when I am dead, and you see the benefits my friends will
shower on the land, then tell all that I was of the same
mind, and was full of naught but kindly feelings. But&mdash;my
great&mdash;love for one so fair&mdash;as your young&mdash;princess&mdash;took
up my thoughts, perhaps, more than should have
been the case.&rdquo; Leonard&rsquo;s voice almost failed him here;
but by a strong effort he recovered himself and went on.
&ldquo;That is all that I would ask; let them remember me
and think kindly of me. You will see in those days who
has spoken truly&mdash;whether I, or Coryon. You will know
how false has been every word he has said to you to-day.
Even what he says about my friends is false; they are
<em>not</em> in his power, nor has he deprived them of their magic
power, as you will all quickly see. To say that by his
atrocious so-called religious rites he has guarded and
advanced this country is a lie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; exclaimed Coryon, who had all this time
been moving restlessly in his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I come from a land&mdash;the greatest on the earth&mdash;that
has an empire upon which the sun ne&rsquo;er sets; we
have no such wicked murders called sacrifices; yet we
are safe against our enemies, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence, I tell thee! What think&rsquo;st thou we care
about thy country or thyself?&rdquo; Coryon burst out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; Leonard went on, disregarding him, &ldquo;that
every word this man utters is a lie. He cannot say one
single sentence without uttering a lie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If thou sayest more, I will have thee scourged as
well as killed,&rdquo; Coryon cried, in growing rage. &ldquo;It
speaketh well to these good people for my patience that
I have let thee have thy say thus far. Never, for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
a year, has mortal dared to flout me to my face as thou
hast done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Coryon!&rdquo; Leonard exclaimed, turning and facing
him, &ldquo;truly did I say that thou could&rsquo;st not speak one
single sentence without uttering some lie, and now thou
art convicted. For I know of one, at least, that has
flouted and dared thee to thy face; one whose spirit
thou couldst not quell; and she but a woman&mdash;her name
Fernina!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this a perfect howl of rage escaped from Coryon&rsquo;s
lips. He sprang up and clutched at the air, and gasped;
and, for a moment, Leonard half thought he would have
a fit. But he recovered himself, and shouted, in a
screaming voice,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seize him! Gag him! Lay him on the feeding-ladle
of our sacred tree! We will see how he fancies
its embrace!&rdquo; Then, turning round and addressing
some one near him, he cried out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring forward the princess, that she may witness
this my act of justice towards the murderer she would
have taken to her bosom. Let my future wife look on.
Ha! ha! ha! My future wife! How dost thou like
the title, murderer of my son, and would-be king?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His rage was something fearful to behold; many even
of his own myrmidons trembled, and they made speed
to do his bidding.</p>

<p>Leonard was seized and bound to the wheeled plank,
and, after trying in vain to turn his head to take one
last look at Ulama, he closed his eyes and resigned
himself to prayer. At the same time Ulama, looking
but the mere ghost of her former self, was led to the
side of Coryon&rsquo;s chair between two women, and forced to
look upon the dreadful scene. At the sight of Leonard
bound to the fatal plank, and the grim tree with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
restless branches ever twisting in avid hunger for their
prey, a look of stony horror came over her face; she
gave one gasping, sobbing cry, and fell back unconscious.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill08"></a>
<img src="images/ill08.jpg" width="405" height="553" alt="" />

<p class="center">ON THE DEVIL-TREE&rsquo;S LADLE.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Page 297.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>For some moments Coryon paused; he was inclined
to wait till Ulama should be restored to consciousness,
for he wanted to prolong the torture of the lovers somewhat
before finally consigning Leonard to his fate; but
his fury mastered him, and he gave the signal to the
two men holding one end of the plank to push it out
along the stone pier.</p>

<p>They had just begun to move it when a shot was
heard, and one of them fell to the ground; and Leonard,
turning his head, saw Templemore, high on the rocks
above, kneeling with his rifle at his shoulder.</p>

<p>Coryon saw it too, and, with a shout, and many threats,
urged the other man to push out the plank; but, instead,
he started back in terror, and only just in time to escape
a second bullet that came singing past his ears and
wounded a soldier standing near.</p>

<p>Coryon, mad with rage and disappointed malice,
snatched a spear from a soldier beside him, and ordered
others in front of him to seize the plank and push it out,
prodding at them with the spear to force obedience; but
one, who stepped forward at his bidding, fell before he
could reach the plank. Meantime, Templemore, followed
by Ergalon and the brave Zonella, had come leaping down
from ledge to ledge, threatening all who barred his way,
and shooting down one or two who tried to stop him.
He now stood, a revolver in each hand, at the end of the
plank, and there he kept a circle around him, while
Ergalon cut the cords by which Leonard was bound,
released the cloth that had been tied round his mouth to
gag him, and helped him to his feet. Immediately he
rushed to Templemore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me a rifle, Jack! Let me shoot down that son
of Satan and rid the earth of him for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ergalon was carrying three rifles, the one Templemore
had been using and two spare ones; one of these he
handed now to Leonard.</p>

<p>But, in the interval, Coryon&rsquo;s chief officer, Dakla, had
taken in the situation; and having already had experience
of the weapons with which he saw Templemore was
armed, had advised Coryon to retreat into the covered-way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is useless to stay here, my lord,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thou
wilt surely be killed! Haste to the shelter while there is
yet time! There I think thou wilt be safe. If not, thou
canst retreat within the gates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dost think the danger is so great, good Dakla?&rdquo;
Coryon asked, incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it, my lord. Haste thee&mdash;and take some
soldiers with thee and keep them between thee and thine
enemies, or thou wilt never reach the shelter alive. I
will leave some men here and take others up on to the
rocks above, whence we can hurl down great stones upon
them. Haply, if no more come, we may yet prevail
against these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coryon and his priests and immediate followers
hastened away, accordingly, leaving the still unconscious
Ulama, in charge of the two women, behind his chair.
He was only just in time, for a soldier he forced to walk
beside him fell by a shot from Leonard&rsquo;s rifle a moment
before they gained the shelter of the covered-way.</p>

<p>Leonard saw the women beside Coryon&rsquo;s chair, and,
though he knew not that Ulama was lying there unconscious,
he guessed she was near the spot; therefore
he feared to fire more shots in that direction; while he
knew it would be useless to fire at the iron-work of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
covered-way. For a space, therefore, there was a pause;
but soon Dakla&rsquo;s men appeared on the rocks above them
and began to roll down stones and boulders.</p>

<p>The position of the little band was now becoming
critical. To retreat, leaving Ulama in the hands of
Coryon, was not to be conceived. Yet they could not
advance, for a compact body of men stood ready to receive
them; and at these they durst not fire lest they might hit
Ulama or one of her attendants. Yet every minute they
stayed where they were increased their danger. Great
masses of rock, started by persons above who showed
only an arm or hand above the ridge, came crashing down
and shooting past them. And, when a head was raised
above it here and there to take a hurried aim, it was seen
only for a second, and gave little opportunity for a shot.</p>

<p>They had had two or three narrow escapes, and had
avoided injury only by leaping out of the path of the rocks
that came crashing and bounding down. Jack urged
Zonella to go back, but she stoutly refused; and he was
at his wits&rsquo; end what course to take, when loud shouting
was heard in the direction of the entrance of the enclosure.
Soon, a rush of armed men in red tunics came along the
roadway at the rear of the black-coated soldiers standing
around Coryon&rsquo;s chair. Instantly Coryon&rsquo;s men gave
way, and rushed across the terrace towards the covered-way;
while the red-coated men poured in and spread
themselves out on either side.</p>

<p>And now could be seen men carrying flags and banners,
and amongst them two of mighty stature; one of them, the
taller, dressed in the coat of mail and the helmet with
silver wings that had been preserved so long in the
museum and that was said to have belonged to the
legendary Mellenda. He wore, too, the great sword that
belonged to the suit, and it seemed, upon his towering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
form, to be of no more than usual and proportionate
size.</p>

<p>As this majestic figure came more closely into view,
accompanied by Colenna and some others of the king&rsquo;s
officers, Leonard and Templemore&rsquo;s astonishment were
great at recognising no other than their friend Monella!</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />

<span class="f8">RALLYING TO THE CALL.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">To</span> make clearer the events described in the previous
chapters, it should be stated that, when Templemore
and Ergalon had returned from their journey down the
canyon in quest of arms and ammunition, they found
with Zonella, who was anxiously awaiting them, a
messenger from Monella.</p>

<p>It was not yet daylight, and the two who had made
the descent and ascent of the difficult path under conditions
of considerable hardship, were very much exhausted.
They were therefore glad, though surprised,
to find that, in their absence, Zonella had provided both
food and wine for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How pleased I am to see you I need scarcely say,&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;But first, eat and drink, while I talk.
I have much to tell, and there is yet time to spare.
Therefore, rest and refresh yourselves, while I relate what
has been made known to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friend, Monella, has done wondrous things.
It seems&mdash;as Ergalon here no doubt has been aware&mdash;that
he has long been quietly making preparations for
some such crisis as the present. Coryon, it is true, by
his treachery, has stolen a march upon him, but he is
being gradually and surely enmeshed in the net that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
lord Monella has drawn around him. For a long time
Sanaima has been secretly drilling numbers of his
followers in Myrlanda, where he has a large store of
arms, and he and Monella have gained over many of
Coryon&rsquo;s men; in particular, some of those sent to
close the subterranean pass. When, therefore, the two,
with many armed men, presented themselves at the
entrance to the pass and found the gates closed against
them, instead of making a desperate fight of it in which
many must have been killed on both sides and the news
of it have been carried to Coryon&rsquo;s ears, they waited for
their friends inside to act. Soon, those of them amongst
the soldiers who guarded the approach, seizing their
opportunity, fell upon their fellows in their sleep, bound
them, and opened the gates. The same thing has occurred
in the palace; all Coryon&rsquo;s soldiers really devoted
to him have been quietly made prisoners, and the palace
is now in the hands of Monella and Sanaima and their
friends; and Coryon knows it not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, when Monella found that you had escaped, he
divined whither you had gone, and sent messengers here
to await your return; and I sent them back at once to
tell him I expected you here ere long. And now another
has arrived with instructions, in case you should return
in time to put them into execution, as&mdash;the Great Spirit
be praised!&mdash;you have. Monella has sent two or three
of Coryon&rsquo;s own people to him with various messages
to allay his suspicions; and Coryon quite believes that
you are still a prisoner, and that Monella is still in
Myrlanda, unable to get through the pass. Others of
Monella&rsquo;s men, dressed in black tunics taken from the
prisoners, are now placed at intervals on guard at all
the approaches to Coryon&rsquo;s retreat; where already, by
this time, nearly all his followers and his adherents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
amongst the people are assembling. There will be some
hundreds altogether; all hostile to you and your friends.
But, when they are all assembled, Monella will gather
together also many hundreds from the people outside,
and march them to the amphitheatre and so surprise
Coryon and all with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how,&rdquo; asked Templemore, &ldquo;if Coryon gets to
hear of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will not. No move will be made till all are
gathered in the amphitheatre; after that, any stragglers
going thither from the town, and any messengers sent
thence by Coryon, will fall into the hands of Monella&rsquo;s
disguised soldiers, and will be quietly seized and bound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. And now what is to be done to make sure of
the safety of our friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The directions are these. You are to go quietly,
through the forest, to the wood at the edge of the amphitheatre
where&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; broke in Ergalon. &ldquo;It is the place,&rdquo;&mdash;turning
to Templemore&mdash;&ldquo;where we stood and looked
down upon the great devil-tree that night. I can take
you by a route that leads through the woods all the way,
and thus we shall not be seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is right,&rdquo; resumed Zonella. &ldquo;When you
get there, you are to remain concealed, and watch all
that goes on, and, unless compelled, do nothing till the
arrival of Monella and his friends. But, if it should be
absolutely necessary to interfere before that to save our
friends, why, then, of course, you must do the best you
can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only hope we may be in time to save them,&rdquo; said
Templemore, with a sigh. &ldquo;I am terribly anxious. Let
us be going; it is already getting light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three then started&mdash;for Zonella insisted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
accompanying them&mdash;and the messenger was sent back
to inform Monella. When they approached the amphitheatre,
four black-coated soldiers suddenly sprang up
before them from among the bushes, where they had
been lying concealed. Templemore drew a pistol, but
Zonella stepped in front of him, and said something in
a low tone to the soldiers, who at once gave way and let
them pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say to them?&rdquo; asked Templemore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave them the pass-word,&rdquo; she answered quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is that, if I may inquire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a word you do not regard with the same feelings
as ourselves,&rdquo; she answered gravely. &ldquo;But in Manoa it
has always been a word to conjure with, and, so it is to-day&mdash;it
is &lsquo;Mellenda.&rsquo;&rdquo; And, while she spoke, she looked
at Templemore half defiantly.</p>

<p>But he made no reply, and they walked on in silence,
and now with all caution, to their destination.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, so soon as the sun had risen, messengers
were hurrying hither and thither amongst the populace,
knocking at doors, and summoning all friendly to the
king and the princess, to assemble in the great square
where stood the large museum. And, in reply to excited
questionings, they often only gave the magic word, &lsquo;Mellenda,&rsquo;
or said, &lsquo;Mellenda calls you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Most of the population were early astir that morning,
restless with anxiety and fear for the princess and her
betrothed, who had, they were told, been carried off by
Coryon. As stated, by the great mass of people their
princess was much beloved by the people; and Leonard,
if he had not gained their affection, had the sympathy,
for her sake, of all loyal subjects, and they were many.
Indeed, all they wanted was a leader; they were too
cowed to take action for themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>No wonder, then, that when such a leader came, announcing
himself as the long-expected, legendary Mellenda,
the whole population, outside those who were gathered
around Coryon in the amphitheatre, rallied to his standard,
and clamoured to be armed and led against their oppressor.
That there were plenty of arms in the museum all well
knew; and, when the messengers ran to and fro, spreading
the news of the return of their hero-king, all the men
who heard the tidings left at once whatever they might
have in hand, and hurried to the museum. There they
found Sanaima with a number of followers already equipped
in the well-known red tunics and winged helmets; and
Colenna and others engaged in giving out arms and
uniforms to many more.</p>

<p>And when, shortly after, Monella appeared at the top
of the wide flight of steps, clad in Mellenda&rsquo;s coat of mail,
with the well-known banner floating above him, and wearing
at his side the mighty sword, every man and woman
and child amongst the crowd below gave a great shout
and knelt before him. Then Monella drew the mighty
sword, that an ordinary man could hardly wield, and,
flourishing it in the air as easily as though it were but
the lightest cane, addressed the kneeling people in sonorous
tones that were heard by all, and were delivered with an
air of exceeding majesty and dignity,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my children! I have returned to you! After
many days the Great Spirit hath led my weary steps
back to my beloved country, there to finish my life&rsquo;s
work, and end a long and troublous journey. My pilgrimage
through the ages hath been a punishment to me, even
as the same dreary time hath been a punishment to you;
a punishment to myself for having placed too high a value,
in the times that are long past, on power and conquest
and dominion; to you, for that your forefathers forsook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
their faith&mdash;the worship of the one Great Spirit&mdash;and
embraced the religion of the powers of darkness, and supported
the atrocious Coryon in a rebellion against their
lawful king, and in the murder of those near and dear to
him. For that, the punishment hath been that they
should be oppressed and cruelly ill-treated by him they
thus supported, through many generations. But, at last,
the anger of the Great Spirit is appeased. He hath led
me hither to deliver this fair land from the horror that
broods over it. I come to you, not with great fleets of
ships, with armies and generals, as of yore; but as a
simple wanderer returning to his home. Yet in my
coming the Great Spirit sent you all a sign; for I arrived
but just in time to save her who is the child of Manoa&rsquo;s
ancient race of kings and&mdash;my own descendant. This
was the sign&mdash;this and the death of Zelus at the same
time; which was a warning to Coryon that he heeded not.
But time presses, and I may not say more now. The
princess and our friends are in great peril, and I go to
save them. I go to break Black Coryon&rsquo;s power for ever,
and to punish him as he deserves. Then will I bring
again to this fair land peace, and happiness, and security
for all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, amid acclamations, and shouts and cries of
delight, Monella&mdash;or Mellenda, as he now called himself&mdash;moved
off towards the place where Coryon, in fancied
security, was boastfully proclaiming his intention to
espouse the princess, and to live henceforth at the palace
as supreme ruler of the country.</p>

<p>Those of Sanaima&rsquo;s followers from Myrlanda, who had
been instructed in their duties, took charge, as officers,
of ranks and companies of the newly-recruited men.
They were assisted by many officers of the king&rsquo;s guard
who had been held prisoners in the palace, but had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
released, and had now changed their blue uniforms for
the red tunics and winged helmets in the museum.</p>

<p>Some, however, remained behind, to equip and despatch
reinforcements as men continued to arrive asking to be
enrolled. Thus, if trouble should arise with Coryon,
Monella would have at his back, eventually, an overwhelming
force. And as the men kept marching off in
companies, the crowd of women and children and old
men collected in the square in which was the museum
stood about in anxious groups, awaiting news; hardly
daring to hope for what all so fervently desired&mdash;the final
downfall of their ruthless tyrant.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />

<span class="f8">&lsquo;THOU ART MY LORD MELLENDA!&rsquo;</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">To</span> return to the scene in the amphitheatre. Monella,
and those with him, advanced with measured tread;
but suddenly his eyes fell on Ulama. For a few moments
he bent over her, then he came slowly to the front and
looked around him, and in that rapid survey he seemed to
take in everything.</p>

<p>Beckoning to Leonard and Zonella he said, when they
had joined him,</p>

<p>&ldquo;The princess lies there in a dead faint. This is no
place for the poor child. Bear her tenderly outside. My
people will protect you.&rdquo; Then he turned again to look
around.</p>

<p>In their surprise at the unexpected inrush, those on the
heights had ceased hurling down the rocks, and now they
gazed in wonderment at Monella and those with him.
Beside him stood a tall man in a white robe upon which
was worked a figure of the sun in diamonds that flashed
and sparkled as he moved. His long hair and beard were
snowy white, his forehead, high and massive, was clear,
and curiously free from lines and wrinkles. It had the
impassive look of one who suffers few earthly cares to
trouble him. His features were pleasant and benevolent
in expression, and the clear grey eyes were open and
candid in their glance. Like Monella, he was far above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the usual height; and, like him, was of imposing presence
and stately mien. Altogether, one would say of him that
he was a <em>good</em> man, a man to be trusted and respected;
he had at the same time the air of one deeply engrossed
in intellectual pursuits, or leading an ascetic life. He
lacked just that touch of tender human sympathy that
made Monella&rsquo;s mere look so fascinating to those with
whom he came in contact, and that bound so thoroughly to
him those who yielded to its subtle influence.</p>

<p>Ergalon had already whispered to the others that the
stranger was Sanaima, the ancient chief of the White
Priesthood; and Templemore regarded him with interest
and curiosity.</p>

<p>Above their heads waved great red banners with strange
devices and elaborately carved standard poles. At a sign
from Monella, Coryon&rsquo;s banner, that floated above his chair,
was pulled down and trampled in the dust; then the largest
of the red ones was hoisted in its place.</p>

<p>Next, Monella quietly seated himself in Coryon&rsquo;s chair
and gazed around the enclosure, his features set and stern,
and his steady, piercing eyes seeming to read the very
heart of every one upon whom he turned his gaze. The
king&rsquo;s ministers and other prisoners had been unbound,
while Templemore had been hastily explaining, to the best
of his ability, all that had taken place.</p>

<p>Presently Monella rose, and, waving his hand towards
the people not clad in Coryon&rsquo;s uniforms, he thus addressed
them,</p>

<p>&ldquo;How comes it, that in this place of evil deeds and
heinous crimes, I find many of the king&rsquo;s peaceful subjects&mdash;or
they who should be peaceful&mdash;ranged round and
calmly looking on at acts of cold-blooded cruelty against
the king&rsquo;s own child and those he calls his friends?
What have ye to say in excuse or extenuation? Choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the highest among ye for a spokesman, and let him come
forward and explain this shameful thing, if so he can.
Else I may include ye all in the punishment I am here
to mete out to these evil-doers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this there was a great hubbub and commotion.
Some of Coryon&rsquo;s companions in the covered-way turned
in a panic to make their escape into the interior gallery;
but found, to their dismay, that the gates were fast
closed and barred against them from within. And when
they glanced out at the rocks above, they saw red-coated
soldiers, who now lined the heights and kept still arriving
in ever-increasing numbers. Dakla and his principal
officers had withdrawn at their advance, and now stood,
with the priests, crowded together just inside the covered-way.
Outside the iron screens the long, trailing branches
swept up from time to time, as though seeking to get at
those within.</p>

<p>After a hurried conference among the people, one of
their number stepped down on to the main terrace and
placed himself before Monella.</p>

<p>Templemore stood on one side of Monella&rsquo;s chair,
rifle in hand, with Ergalon close by holding the spare
rifles, all ready loaded. He watched with growing
wonder the continual arrival of red-coated soldiers on
all sides of the rocky ridges. They all carried spears,
or swords and shields, and wore the curious helmets
ornamented with little silver wings that he had seen
in the museum. And now, amongst them, were to be
seen many citizens in ordinary dress. But all kept a
space between themselves and those who had been there
on their arrival; their manner towards these was evidently
unfriendly and threatening; and, since the newcomers
outnumbered the others, including all Coryon&rsquo;s
people, the position of the latter was growing anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
but comfortable. And still the red-coated men kept
coming, pushing those in advance of them into positions
lower down and farther round the terraces of the
enclosure.</p>

<p>There was a general hush when the one who had
been chosen spokesman came forward and stood in front
of Monella, who asked curtly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thy name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Galaima,&rdquo; was the reply, given in a clear, unhesitating
voice. &ldquo;I have been chosen by those whom thou didst
but now address, to speak in their name. Seeing that
punishment hath been spoken of, we desire first to ask
what authority thou hast to speak in the king&rsquo;s name; by
what right thou dost threaten us; and who thou art?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have the right to ask those questions,&rdquo; returned
Monella coldly. &ldquo;Know then that I am King of Manoa&mdash;thy
king, and the king of Coryon, and of all in this
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;King of Manoa!&rdquo; echoed Galaima in surprise, while
similar exclamations broke forth around. &ldquo;But, my lord&mdash;I
speak with all respect&mdash;how can that be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The King Dranoa is sick even unto death. His
illness hath been hastened in its course by acts of base
treachery perpetrated by Coryon&mdash;with whom I shall
deal anon. Finding himself dying and unable to lead
his soldiers to the rescue of his child, he hath abdicated
in my favour, for me to hold the post so long as I think
fit in the interests of the nation. Here (taking out from
his bosom a roll of parchment) is his sign-manual duly
sealed and executed in the presence of the High Priest
Sanaima and others who are with me; and here is his
sceptre of office, and this is his signet-ring&mdash;these being
given to me by him in token of my authority, and also in
the presence of Sanaima and many others you see around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
me. Is it not so, friends?&rdquo; Monella demanded, turning
to Sanaima and the others near.</p>

<p>A loud shout went up in confirmation; then, at a wave
of Monella&rsquo;s hand, there was again a deep, expectant
silence.</p>

<p>Coryon had come out from the covered-way on hearing
the unlooked-for and unwelcome news, and now stood,
a little in advance of his own people, an attentive listener
and observer of what was going on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou hast heard,&rdquo; resumed Monella, in the same
cold, stern tone. &ldquo;I come duly armed with authority to
punish, and I have the power. Do thou and thy fellows
yonder desire to take part with the traitor Coryon, and
fight against us; or do ye disavow him and throw yourselves
upon my mercy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord, with all respect, I ask for the reply to my
last question. We came hither&mdash;of a certainty I and
my immediate friends so came&mdash;to protest against the
king&rsquo;s choice of a son-in-law. We were unwilling to
have thrust upon us, as our future king, one who is of
a different race&mdash;who is a stranger in the land&mdash;and who,
so far as it appeareth, hath no claim to royal dignity.
Now&mdash;with all respect, I say again&mdash;for all we know,
those same objections apply to thine own case. If, however,
I am wrong in this, and thou canst convince us
that thou hast reasonable claim to the dignity the king
hath conferred upon thee, then we are ready to submit
ourselves as loyal subjects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thy logic is good,&rdquo; observed Monella with bitter
emphasis, &ldquo;for thy present purpose; but it faileth to
explain how it came about that, instead of making known
your sentiment in a petition and awaiting the king&rsquo;s
friendly explanation, as befitted faithful subjects, ye
supported Coryon in his treasonable acts&mdash;in kidnapping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the king&rsquo;s daughter and his friends. Further, ye were all
proceeding, at Coryon&rsquo;s mere suggestion, to put to death
this stranger, without giving him either time or opportunity
to afford the information ye now profess yourself so
anxious to obtain. However, thou shalt have thy question
answered&mdash;and, that done, let me warn thee that I am in
no mood to suffer further trifling. King Dranoa&rsquo;s good-natured
weakness, and my own misplaced leniency, have
already wrought too much misunderstanding. Ask thy
question of the lord Colenna, the king&rsquo;s High Chamberlain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Colenna stepped forward, and, in a loud, sonorous
voice, that resounded throughout the vast amphitheatre,
cried out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know ye all, by the command of King Dranoa and the
unanimous assent of his ministers, that the great lord
Mellenda, who hath been hitherto known amongst us as
Monella&mdash;which in ancient times had the same signification
as the word Mellenda&mdash;hath made himself known to his
people, and hath assumed the office of ruler of the countries
of Manoa and Myrlanda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this extraordinary announcement Coryon moved
back into the covered-way with unsteady and almost
tottering steps; while Monella rose and, with another
wave of the hand, signalled for silence. Turning to
Sanaima, he asked, with quiet dignity, but in a ringing
voice that all could hear,</p>

<p>&ldquo;And thou, august head of our religion, faithful through
so many years of persecution and despair, who dost <em>thou</em>
say I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Sanaima raised his hands to heaven as though to
invoke a blessing, and said, solemnly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the name of the Great Spirit whom I serve, I
recognise and welcome thee, my lord Mellenda!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>But still Monella waved his hand for silence; and,
raising his voice, he cried,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come forth, Black Coryon! I command thee! Come
forth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Coryon came forward, and stood before him; but
he durst not meet his eyes.</p>

<p>Monella slowly raised his arm and straightened it,
pointing his finger at his enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who, foul Coryon, who dost <em>thou</em> say I
am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the space of a few seconds Coryon looked his
questioner in the face. There was a brief struggle to
hold his own and to repel with proud defiance the glance
Monella turned on him; then, bowing his head, he murmured
humbly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou art my lord Mellenda!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then a great shout went up. Again, and again, and
yet again it was repeated. &ldquo;Mellenda! Mellenda!
Mellenda!&rdquo; It rang out from far and near. It was taken
up by a crowd of women and children without the gates,
and thence it travelled back and echoed from one side of
the rocky amphitheatre to the other.</p>

<p>When, once more, there was silence, Galaima dropped
upon one knee and begged for clemency for himself and
friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay down your arms, each one of you, and go!&rdquo; the
answer came. &ldquo;Let me not look upon your faces again
yet awhile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Monella, turning to Coryon&rsquo;s soldiers, commanded
them also to lay down their arms and surrender
themselves prisoners.</p>

<p>Here Coryon showed the first signs of resistance he had
yet exhibited, and his officers, who had stood watching
for a sign from him, withdrew in a body into the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
to the covered-way, seeing in it the best opportunities for
a last desperate fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord forgetteth,&rdquo; said Coryon, &ldquo;that he hath given
no assurance that the lives of my people and servants
will be spared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can make no terms with thee or with thy minions.
I came here to punish the evil-doers, as well as to save
my friends,&rdquo; returned Monella with grave meaning.
&ldquo;Thou hast been warned again and again since I came
into the land; I sent thee word that, if I came to thee, I
would bring retribution in my hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; urged Coryon, in the smooth, oily manner
he could put on at will, &ldquo;if we submit, my lord will
require no more? Thy friends are safe; no harm hath
been done to them. May it not be that I remain here
with mine own people, within mine own domain&mdash;the
domain that hath been mine for centuries&mdash;in friendly
alliance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Monella, turning wrathfully upon
the crafty hypocrite with a blaze of anger in his eyes, as
might a lion turn upon a snapping cur. &ldquo;Thou darest to
speak to me of <em>alliance</em>! Alliance with <em>thee</em>! With a
thing so foul, so loathsome, so detestable as thou! Shall
the eagle ally himself with the carrion crow? Enough!&rdquo;
He broke off, in indignation at the insult, and, turning
to the officers of his own party who stood near, cried,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seize them and bind them! Every one! Let not
one escape! But take them alive, if possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A large number of the red-coated soldiers, led by their
officers, now advanced upon the crowd of Coryon&rsquo;s people
gathered at the entrance to the covered-way. Many of
the latter came forward at once and threw down their
arms; while others stood irresolute. Coryon, himself,
made no effort to escape, and was seized by a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
men, who quickly bound his hands behind him. But
Dakla and all Coryon&rsquo;s priests and some half-dozen of
his lieutenants and a few soldiers&mdash;perhaps those who
felt themselves most guilty&mdash;stood defiantly some little
distance within the gallery, determined to resist capture
to the last.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX.<br />

<span class="f8">A TERRIBLE VENGEANCE!</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Of</span> all the spectators of what had occurred in the
amphitheatre, no one, probably, was so utterly
astonished and helplessly bewildered as was Templemore.
At Monella&rsquo;s assumption of the royal office he felt no
great surprise. It seemed almost a natural thing, taking
all the circumstances into account, that the king, finding
his daughter stolen away and himself too ill to pursue
and punish her captors, should delegate his authority
to the man in whom he had of late reposed such confidence.
But at Colenna&rsquo;s announcement that in Monella
he recognised the long-expected, legendary Mellenda,
Templemore was, as may be supposed, considerably
startled; and his perplexity was increased when Sanaima,
in his turn, subscribed to Colenna&rsquo;s declaration; but
when Coryon himself affirmed his belief in the marvellous
assertion, Templemore&rsquo;s ideas became so hopelessly confused,
that he knew not what to think or what to make of
it. In other circumstances he would, no doubt, have
quietly settled matters in his own mind by deciding
that all present had become victims to a passing fit
of madness or transient delusion; but the grim realities of
the strange drama that was being played before him made
it impossible to explain things by any such hypothesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in the midst of the conflict thus proceeding
in his mind, that Dakla and his fellows took up their
attitude of defiance; so Templemore promptly decided
to postpone further thought upon the matter. It was
sufficient, for the moment, that there was the prospect
of a fight in which his friends would need his help;
and he began handling his rifle significantly, glancing
while he did so at Monella.</p>

<p>The latter had laid his hand upon his shoulder as
though to stay him until he should have had more time
to study the situation, when a rumbling noise was heard,
and an iron door shot out from the inside wall a little
distance from the end of the covered-way, completely
closing it and shutting out from view the men within.
So suddenly had this been done that Dakla was almost
caught by it, and would have been jammed against
the iron pillar into which it fitted, but that he had
managed to withdraw himself inside just in time to
escape it.</p>

<p>The impression upon the minds of those outside was
that this unlooked-for obstacle that intervened between
those within the protected gallery and their enemies,
had been purposely made use of to gain time to force
open the interior gates and thus assist their escape into
the labyrinth of passages beyond. The first effect was
to dishearten those of Coryon&rsquo;s adherents who were still
outside in a state of indecision. Seeing themselves thus,
as they thought, incontinently abandoned by their leaders,
they threw down their arms without further ado, submitted
to their captors, and, in few minutes, were pinioned and
marched out of the way.</p>

<p>It now became a question what steps were to be taken
to follow up those who had so cleverly escaped, temporarily,
at all events, from their pursuers. These were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
after Coryon himself, the most guilty of the whole
atrocious confederacy; and Templemore turned to Monella
with a look of inquiry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What say you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;shall we try whether that
door is bullet-proof?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Monella again laid his hand upon the other&rsquo;s arm,
and gazed, as though in expectation, first at Coryon&mdash;who
was standing out in the centre of the terrace, guarded by
two soldiers&mdash;and then, from him, to that part of the
covered-way nearest to the rocks that ended it. His
quick eye had noticed that Coryon seemed as much taken
by surprise as all the rest, and that there was, in his face,
no trace of that triumphant satisfaction that might have
been expected if this man&oelig;uvre of his chief friends had
been looked for. Instead, there was a fixed look that was
momentarily changing from surprise to terror.</p>

<p>Templemore, following Monella&rsquo;s gaze, noted all this&mdash;and
so did others. A hush fell upon all present; every one
looked at Coryon, and, from him, to the length of grated
iron screens, over the face of which the branches of the
fatal tree were playing with busy sweep, evidently aware,
by some unfailing instinct, that there was plenty of prey
for them within. And it was now noticed that the larger
number of the longer branches had gathered themselves
upon that side.</p>

<p>Gradually, the look on Coryon&rsquo;s face changed into one
of absolute horror, the while he stood staring at the
outside of the covered-gallery.</p>

<p>To make what follows clear, it is necessary to describe
this covered-way a little more in detail. It has already
been explained that it formed the approach to an opening
in the rock&mdash;closed by gates&mdash;which was the principal
entrance to Coryon&rsquo;s retreat. When unprotected by the
sliding gratings at the side, it was so near to the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
devil-tree that the longer branches could sweep its whole
width for some distance in front of the gates. At the
side was some masonry, above which the rock rose steep
and almost over-hanging. At the end, above the entrance,
the rock rose also abruptly, and then followed the line of
the arena, shutting in the latter at this part by a rocky
wall that rose perpendicularly some fifty or sixty feet. But
the part within reach of the tree was roofed over by iron
gratings, forming a sort of verandah, which, in turn, could
be rendered safe from the terrible branches by sliding
grated doors or shutters that could, by machinery within,
be moved forward in telescopic fashion along the whole
length accessible to the tree, and a short distance beyond.
Thus, when the side &lsquo;shutters&rsquo; were withdrawn, the
entrance-gates were very effectually guarded by the tree
itself. When they were extended, they, in conjunction
with the roof, constituted an efficient protection to the
covered-way. But herein lay also a cunningly-devised
and deadly trap; for, just within the entrance of this
covered-gallery, was another iron door that could be
moved across the passage so as to imprison any one
caught between it and the gates at the other end. This
door came out of a scarcely noticeable slot in the masonry
at the side; and it was situated far enough along to place
those thus caught within reach of the tree, if the side
shutters were withdrawn.</p>

<p>Doubtless, many had fallen into this frightful trap.
Thinking the gallery well protected they would walk
unsuspiciously along it towards the closed gates, when
those watching from within could close the gallery behind
them and open the sides; and their fate would then be
sealed.</p>

<p>This was the only part of the main terrace within reach
of the tree. Round the remainder of the amphitheatre it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
was far removed from it, and was of ample width. Only
at this part, and upon the stone pier that jutted out
towards the tree from the centre, or down in the arena
itself, was there danger to any one moving about within
the vast enclosure.</p>

<p>At a point in the cliff, high above the covered-way,
was a small grated door in the rock. This was another
entrance to Coryon&rsquo;s fastness; but it was sufficiently
protected by the nature of the steep and narrow path by
which alone it could be reached.</p>

<p>While those gathered around the enclosure, following
Coryon&rsquo;s fixed gaze, were watching the outside faces of
the sliding doors or shutters, these doors began to move;
and, amidst a hush of awe-struck expectation, they disclosed
a gap which gradually widened, and through
which the fatal branches quickly darted. Then, from
within, arose a fearful and appalling cry, as the miserable
prisoners caught in this trap of their own contriving
began to realise their situation. The gap grew wider,
and, anon, another opened farther on, and into this the
searching branches likewise entered, hungry for the prey
within. And, as the gaps grew wider, they disclosed to
view an awful scene. Some dozens of terror-stricken
wretches could be seen fighting and struggling with the
writhing branches and with each other, amidst a deafening
din of screams, and shrieks, and yells; the officers and
soldiers using their swords, and the priests and others
their daggers, in a hopeless contest with the twisting
branches that kept coiling around them. In their mad
struggles and desperate efforts the combatants fought
with one another, the stronger striving to push the weaker
in front of them; the latter, in turn, stabbing backwards
at those who thus tried to make use of them. Three or
four, in headlong terror, leaped from the terrace on to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
ground beneath, where they fell with dull thuds, and
probably broken limbs; but, ere they could rise, their
legs were entangled in the ubiquitous branches and escape
became impossible. Dakla was seen, with a sword in one
hand and a dagger in the other, at one moment slashing
furiously at the branches that assailed him, at another
striving to hold in front of him Skelda, the next in rank
to Coryon. Two of the priests were seen engaged in a
hand-to-hand struggle, apparently unmindful of the coils
that gradually encircled them and presently dragged both
out, locked together, and still frantically fighting with
each other. They were carried up to the top of the tree,
and disappeared, still fighting, within the cavity. But,
though the rapacious tree had now as much as it could,
for the time, dispose of in this way, it had no intention
of giving up its hold upon the others. These it grappled
in its toils, dragging them about hither and thither, dangling
them now this way and now that, but never giving one
a chance of escape&mdash;evidently bent on saving all up for
future meals&mdash;perhaps days hence. It was a gruesome
scene that shocked and sickened the spectators, for all
they were so incensed, and justly so, against the victims.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the iron door in the rock above had opened,
and a woman was seen hurrying down the dangerous path.
Her hair was streaming loosely about her shoulders, her
eyes were wild and fierce, and she laughed and gesticulated
in a fashion that made those who watched her think her
crazy. She made her way to where Coryon still stood,
a silent witness of what was going on before him; and
she then paused and surveyed the awful scene with a
smile that was almost devilish.</p>

<p>Just then Skelda leaped out of the covered-way on to
the ground beneath; then, rising to his feet, looked round
despairingly, and, glancing up, he met the fierce gaze and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
cruel smile of the woman he had so shamefully betrayed.
She pointed her finger at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; she cried triumphantly, &ldquo;this is <em>my</em> work,
Skelda! <em>I</em> closed the gates and shut you all in with the
outer door. My love to you, my&mdash;<em>husband</em>!&rdquo; This last
word was hissed out at him between clenched teeth.
&ldquo;My love to you, dear friend.&rdquo; And she mockingly threw
him a kiss on the tips of her fingers. Then, when the
wretched Skelda&rsquo;s feet were dragged from under him by
a branch that had coiled round his legs, she addressed
herself to Coryon, who had now fixed his eyes upon her,
his evil face twitching convulsively with the fury he could
not suppress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, great Coryon! Mighty Coryon! All-powerful
Coryon! See my handiwork! Yes, <em>mine</em>! See what
a woman&rsquo;s wit hath done for thy precious friends. What
a day to live to see! I saw thee in the clutch of thy
prisoner; heard thee called &lsquo;coward&rsquo; to thy face. It
was sweet that; and sweet to see thy prey escape thee!
And this is sweet too! Look at thy great friend Skelda;
see how he kicks and shrieks! Think of it&mdash;all my doing!
See how Dakla glares! Now he and Palana are fighting
one another! Oh, but it is a brave sight to look upon!
Fit even for the gods ye have served so well! I think I
am almost avenged; but the sweetest of all is yet to come&mdash;when
I see <em>thee</em> given to the tree, as I <em>shall</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coryon struggled, but vainly, to get at her. She
shrugged her shoulders and turned her back upon him,
then slowly approached Monella; the look of triumph
died away, and an expression that was partly of sorrow,
and partly of hard determination, took its place. Arrived
in front of him, she threw herself humbly on her knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; she cried, with clasped hands, &ldquo;I crave
justice at thy hands, I <em>demand</em> it! In the names of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
countless women and fair children whom yonder monster
hath given over to the same awful death that hath now
overtaken his own creatures; in the name of my own
bitter wrongs and sufferings, I demand that this loathsome
being shall not escape his just reward. I ask that he be
given up to that tree to which he has consigned so many;
and that first he be confined in the same cell from which I
have escaped. I will lead thy officers to it. Let him be
kept there till the wicked tree, with recovered appetite,
shall be ready to devour him! Let him there endure
the tortures he hath inflicted upon me and countless
others!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who art thou, daughter?&rdquo; asked Monella gently.</p>

<p>She shook her head mournfully and replied, much as
she had to Leonard,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am called Fernina, lord. Once, I was a joyous-hearted
wife and mother; but Coryon stole me away from
my home to give me to his friend Skelda. What I am
now I scarcely know; misery and suffering, and shame
and infamies unutterable have made me&mdash;alas, I know not
what!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From my heart I pity thee, my daughter. Thy wrongs
cry out for punishment, and thy prayer is just. Show my
officers the place. Coryon <em>shall</em> be the last meal of the
accursed fetish he has fed with the blood of so many
victims.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go back by the way by which I came,&rdquo; Fernina
answered, &ldquo;and will make safe again the covered-way;
then will I open the gates, that thine officers may take
him in that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the covered-way was empty; every occupant
had been dragged or had leaped out and was held in
the toils below. There was, therefore, nothing to prevent
its being used again. Fernina went up the path and disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
from view; then soon the sliding shutters were
seen to move back in their places; and, shortly after, she
appeared at one end of the covered-way and beckoned to
those in charge of Coryon to follow her. He was led
down and placed in the same cell she had occupied, and
there shut in and left to himself, and to look out, if he
chose, at his friends in the tree&rsquo;s tenacious arms outside.
Some of them were so close he could have spoken with
them.</p>

<p>After Coryon had been removed, Sanaima turned to
Monella; then raised his hands and eyes towards heaven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us thank the Great Spirit,&rdquo; said he solemnly,
&ldquo;that hath, at last, delivered our enemies into our hands,
and that without the loss of a life, or so much as a wound
upon our side!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Monella added a heartfelt &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of a truth,&rdquo; he added reverently, &ldquo;the wicked have
been caught to-day in their own snare. At last, we may
truly rejoice that the curse hath been removed, for ever,
from the fair land of Manoa. But this is a fearful sight;
let us hasten from it. But ere we do, Sanaima, send
kindly and trustworthy people to care for the poor woman
Fernina and the other women and children who are somewhere
within. I cannot now stay longer; I must look
after the princess and return to the palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will remain and look to them myself,&rdquo; answered
Sanaima. &ldquo;Now that the Great Spirit hath at last given
them into my charge, it is a trust that belongeth to me,
and to me alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the foregoing events, several messengers had
passed to and fro delivering messages, in low tones, to
Monella or some of his officers, and speeding away again
with their replies, or upon other errands. In this way
Monella had learned that the princess had recovered from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
her long swoon and expressed a strong desire to return
to the palace to her father, and he had sent back word to
Leonard to accompany her.</p>

<p>When, therefore, Templemore, with Monella and many
more, reached the great gates on leaving the amphitheatre,
they found Ulama and all those with her gone, and they
now hastened to the palace after them.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.<br />

<span class="f8">&lsquo;THE SON OF APALANO!&rsquo;</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">On</span> leaving the amphitheatre, Monella and his followers
formed a long and imposing procession. Only a
few had been left behind to guard the prisoners. These
last were immured in cells pointed out by Fernina, who
was well acquainted with the interior arrangements of
Coryon&rsquo;s retreat. For within the rocks was an almost
endless series of passages and galleries opening, at the
further end, on to an extensive hanging terrace on the
very face of the great precipice that formed one end of
Roraima&rsquo;s perpendicular sides. Even those of Coryon&rsquo;s
followers who had gone over secretly to Monella, were
only partially acquainted with the interior of this fastness;
hence Fernina&rsquo;s assistance was found of great use by
Sanaima and those who remained with him.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be said that the procession, as it left the
great gates of the amphitheatre, exhibited, at first, many
signs of having just been engaged in a victorious and
successful expedition. Those who formed it were, for the
most part, silent and preoccupied; for the scenes they had
witnessed&mdash;and that, as they knew, were still in progress&mdash;were
of too horrible a character to be readily dismissed
from the mind. But, as they proceeded on their way,
they met and were joined by fresh bands of red-coated
sympathisers; and these, not having the same reasons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
for repressing their elation at the result of the day&rsquo;s
proceedings, broke out into cheering as they passed the
groups of people who were now coming out to meet
them. For messengers had gone on in advance to tell
the news, and the crowds who had been waiting so
anxiously in the city, soon learned that Coryon&rsquo;s downfall
was an accomplished fact. They had already heard
the good tidings of the rescue of the princess and her
lover and friends, and were only waiting for this last
crowning announcement; when it came, they became
almost delirious with joy, and soon poured out to meet
the victors and give them an enthusiastic welcome.</p>

<p>Thus the procession that started so quietly&mdash;almost
in sadness, as it seemed&mdash;from the dismal amphitheatre,
became at last, as it entered the city, a veritable triumphal
pageant, meeting on all sides, and returning, cheers and
shouts of joy and exultation. And when Monella, with
Templemore, Colenna, and others came into view in the
centre of the long array, every head was uncovered and
every knee bent. Then, when he had passed, the excited
crowds rose and shouted again louder than ever. And
well might they do so; for they&mdash;and only they&mdash;knew
the full meaning of the horrors from which they had that
day been delivered.</p>

<p>By the time they had neared the king&rsquo;s palace, the
crowd had grown so dense that it was with some difficulty
that space was cleared for the passage of the principal
persons into the building. At the entrance, under the
great archway, Leonard, looking pale and anxious,
awaited them. Running forward to meet Monella, he
said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard the news and congratulate you all.
But I am in sore distress about the princess. We had
much ado to bring her here, and I fear she is very ill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Let me entreat you to go and see her at once, and then
let me know what you think about her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly will I, my son,&rdquo; replied Monella kindly,
and hurried away; while Leonard turned and greeted
Templemore and the others with him. Then they all
entered the palace and went up one of the great staircases
and on to a terrace overlooking the open space
where the crowd was assembled, and there awaited
Monella&rsquo;s return.</p>

<p>Presently he came to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The princess is weak and much depressed,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and will require care for awhile; but I see no cause
for anxiety. Naturally, the poor child is terribly upset.
She grieves, too, about the condition of the king her
father, and wishes to help nurse him, but this she has
not strength for at present. Patience, my son. Be
patient and of good heart.&rdquo; He looked with pity and
concern at Leonard&rsquo;s haggard face with its hollow,
dark-ringed eyes and its worn-out look. &ldquo;You have
suffered&mdash;cruelly&mdash;I can see,&rdquo; he added, placing his hand
gently on the young man&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;You have been
sorely tried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; returned Leonard with a heavy sigh. &ldquo;You
cannot imagine what I have been through! My thoughts
still dwell upon the horror of it; my eyes still see the
sights I gazed upon! I feel as though I shall never be
my old self again. And Ulama! Though I do not yet
know how much she saw or knew, I sadly believe she
shares my feelings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are both worn out&mdash;exhausted, my son. Wait
but a space&mdash;while I speak to the crowd and dismiss them&mdash;and
then I will give you a cordial and refreshment;
after that you must lie down and have a long sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear even to sleep,&rdquo; said Leonard, shaking his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
head sadly. &ldquo;I dread the thought of sleep, for I know
but too well what my dreams will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, my son, have no fear. I will promise you
dreamless, restful sleep,&rdquo; Monella answered, and moved
away to the front of the terrace.</p>

<p>At the sight of his commanding form and upraised
hand the shouts and noise and all the subdued roar that
till now had been continuous were hushed. Then, as
with one accord, all uncovered and fell upon their knees.
He spoke a few brief words and then dismissed them,
pointing out that his friends were in need of rest and
quiet.</p>

<p>The crowd, in respectful obedience, quietly dispersed,
and Monella, motioning Elwood and Templemore to follow
him, led them into his private apartments and there mixed
and administered to both certain drinks that had an
immediate and wonderfully revivifying effect. These
potions had also the advantage of stimulating their
appetites, so that they were the better enabled to take
the nourishment he pressed upon them. Then he accompanied
them to their sleeping chambers and bade them
lie down and take the repose they so sorely needed.
None of the three had had any sleep or rest&mdash;for Leonard&rsquo;s
swoon in his cell and subsequent state of torpor could
scarcely be so called&mdash;for the past two nights. The two
young men were not only worn out, but in that excited
state in which the brain seems to insist upon going over
and over and over again the events of the previous
troubled time, in that ceaseless, monotonous whirl that
makes all efforts at sleep so useless. But Monella&mdash;who
alone showed no sign of the strain all had undergone&mdash;sat
down by the side of each in succession for a short time,
and talked to him in his low, musical tones. What he
talked of, or what he did, neither could afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
remember; but the effect was magical. As Leonard
afterwards expressed it, a soothing, delicious sense of
drowsy rest crept over his senses; a rest that was not
sleep, for he could still hear the usual sounds around,
but gradually growing hushed and muffled. Then came
a sensation as of being lifted and wafted away by a gentle
wind; and in the sighing of the breeze there seemed a
delightful strain of music, a dreamy lullaby that carried
with it a restful peace sinking imperceptibly into untroubled
repose.</p>

<p>The strangest thing, perhaps, is that even the unimpressionable
Templemore was affected in the same way,
as he afterwards admitted. Nor was that all; for, on
awaking, he was conscious of having had the most delicious
dreams, though he could not quite recall their subject.
For some time he lay in a state of blissful ease, striving
to recollect the dream that had left sensations so delicious,
and afraid to rouse himself for fear the remembrance
should vanish altogether. He could hear the usual sounds
going on in the palace, the tramp of armed men, and
clashing and jingling of arms; but he was only half-conscious
of them. Then he heard his name called in
tones that seemed to come from the far distance, and,
opening his eyes, he saw Monella standing beside his
couch and regarding him with a grave smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wake up, my friend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is time you roused
yourself. I wish to have some talk with you and Leonard.
You have slept for eight-and-forty hours!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Templemore sat up and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I had slept for months,&rdquo; he answered in a
half-dazed way. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve had such curious dreams, or
visions; I feel quite sorry to be awake again. It&rsquo;s a
strange thing for <em>me</em> to talk like that, I know,&rdquo; he added
with hesitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you dream of?&rdquo; asked Leonard, who had
entered in time to hear the other&rsquo;s concluding words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the strange part of it,&rdquo; returned Templemore,
looking perplexed and somewhat sheepish. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a
most extraordinary dream of some kind, or a vision or
something&mdash;<em>that</em> I know, yet I cannot remember what it
was. All I can now tell you is that it was something
so extremely pleasant that it has left the most agreeable
sensations behind it. My very blood seems in a warm,
delicious glow from it. What can it be?&rdquo; he added,
looking in a bewildered way from one to the other.</p>

<p>But Monella made no comment, and went away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been just the same with me,&rdquo; said Leonard, in a
low voice, that had an expression almost of awe in it.
&ldquo;Monella woke me about half an hour ago and I felt much
like what you have described.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very odd,&rdquo; Templemore returned thoughtfully.
&ldquo;It must be the drink he gave us. Do you remember
what Harry Lorien said of him? That he believed
Monella was a magician? I begin to think him a
wizard myself. But, dear boy, how much better you
look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do you, Jack; and he tells me Ulama is the
same&mdash;and it&rsquo;s all his doing, you know. He <em>is</em> a wizard;
and that&rsquo;s all there is to be said about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The question is,&rdquo; Jack went on, &ldquo;what was it he gave
us? Here it has made us sleep nearly forty-eight hours;
and it seems, has done us, in that time, as much good as
one would have thought would have taken a week or two
to accomplish, and yet it has left no dull, drowsy, listless
feeling, such as opiates generally do. I can&rsquo;t make it
out.&rdquo; And, shaking his head gravely, Templemore went
to take his morning plunge.</p>

<p>When they sought Monella, he bade Leonard give him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the particulars of all that had occurred to him. Leonard
recounted them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seemed very terrible to me,&rdquo; he said when he had
finished, &ldquo;at the time; and truly I thought I should
never get over it. Yet&mdash;now&mdash;it seems such a long while
ago&mdash;so far off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is well, my son,&rdquo; returned Monella. &ldquo;For it
has been a sore trial. I have heard about <em>you</em>,&rdquo; he
continued, turning to Templemore, &ldquo;from the lady Zonella
and from Ergalon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I owe a great debt to her&mdash;to him&mdash;to both,&rdquo; Templemore
replied. &ldquo;Without their aid I fear things would
have gone badly with Leonard, and myself too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Coryon had ably laid his treacherous schemes,
and we all have reason to be thankful for their failure,&rdquo;
said Monella solemnly. &ldquo;Things came to a crisis just
then. I had just matured certain plans that Sanaima
and I had laid out; and only the day before my
long-lost memory returned to me, and I remembered,
all in a flash, as it were, the whole of my former
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you were&mdash;that is&mdash;are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Templemore
began; but stopped and looked confused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that I am indeed Mellenda,&rdquo; was the reply,
given with an air of grave conviction. &ldquo;I know the
statement sounds incredible to you; you are of that
nature, have been brought up in that kind of school, that
makes such a thing sound impossible. But if <em>I</em> myself
feel and know that it is true, and if my people around me
know it and not only admit it but rejoice in it, then, for
me, that is sufficient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Templemore assented, feeling very uncomfortable
under the other&rsquo;s gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still&mdash;to you&mdash;let me be, while you remain here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
simply what I have been before&mdash;your friend Monella.
I am the same being to-day that you have known and, I
hope, liked&mdash;that you have joined with in facing danger
and adventure&mdash;I am the same! The mere fact that I
remember things now that I had forgotten before makes
no difference to me or to our friendship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was said with a look of such kind regard that
Templemore felt his own heart swell with responsive
feeling. It was true he had a strong inclination to regard
the other as a sincere, but self-deceiving mystic; but,
apart from that&mdash;apart from this strange delusion, as he
deemed it, about Monella&rsquo;s being the legendary Mellenda&mdash;Templemore
looked upon him with feelings of the
greatest admiration, affection, and respect. And he had
never been so conscious of those feelings as at this
moment. He took the hand that the other extended to
him, and bent his head respectfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he in a low tone, &ldquo;no son could respect and
reverence a beloved and honoured father more than
I do you. No one could feel prouder of the love and
esteem you have been kind enough to show me; no
people, I feel satisfied, could have a worthier, a more
disinterested, or exalted ruler. If I find it difficult to
realise the marvel that you have related, if I have the
idea that, perhaps, you are mistaking your own dreams
for actual realities, it is not from any doubt of your
sincerity or veracity&mdash;only that in that way alone can I
bring myself to explain the wonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I, on my side, respect the honesty that will
not allow you to pretend what you cannot feel,&rdquo; was
the reply. &ldquo;To you let me be simply Monella, and let
us continue on our old terms of mutual friendship and
esteem. And now I am going to rouse your wonder
and surprise with yet one other unexpected statement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Your friend Leonard here is not the son of the parents he
has all his life supposed himself to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard sprang up with an exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will explain how. You have already told us&rdquo;&mdash;this
to Leonard&mdash;&ldquo;how that your supposed father and
mother, with yourself, and your Indian nurse, once stayed
some time with a strange people in a secluded valley
among the peaks of the Andes. I was not there at the
time, but they were my people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your people!&rdquo; Leonard repeated with astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my son, my people! Apalano, and two or
three others of whom you have heard me speak&mdash;all,
alas, now dead! I was informed of your visit when I
next came back to them, for a while, from my wanderings.
I heard of it and what had happened; how Apalano&rsquo;s
little child&mdash;his only one&mdash;had been killed by a venomous
serpent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The child of Apalano!&rdquo; Leonard repeated in amaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The two children,&rdquo; Monella continued&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Elwood&rsquo;s
child and Apalano&rsquo;s&mdash;were wonderfully alike, and your
nurse, the Indian woman Carenna, was very fond of both,
and was in the habit of taking them out together. She
was out with them thus one day, and left them both
sleeping in the shade of a clump of trees while she
went a few yards away to gather some fruit. She
returned (so she says) in a few minutes; then, thinking
one of the children had a strange look she picked it
up in alarm; at the same moment a serpent glided out
from under its clothes and went away, hissing, into
the wood. But the child was dead; and it was the
child of the Englishman. Then Carenna, frantic with
grief, and afraid to tell the truth to her master and
mistress, exchanged the clothes and ornaments of the
children. The trick succeeded; for the dead infant was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
swollen and discoloured; and Apalano mourned the death
of his only child, when it went away, in reality, with the
strangers and their Indian nurse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Leonard excitedly, &ldquo;I am&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ranelda, son of my well-beloved friend! Ah,&rdquo; said
Monella, sadly, &ldquo;it was a cruel thing to do. It preyed
upon the mind of my friend, and, I truly believe, brought
on the fatal sickness. But for that he might have lived,
haply, to see at last the land of his fathers&mdash;might have
been one of us here to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard felt the tears come into his eyes at the picture
called up by this suggestion; and he said in a low tone,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! My poor father! It was cruel&mdash;very cruel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems so,&rdquo; Monella returned with a sigh. &ldquo;But
God so willed it. And He has also willed that you
should be led back to your own nation&mdash;that, after
many days, you should join with me in the work that
I had set myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very wonderful. Yet it seems to me to explain
those strange dreams and visions that were ever urging
me on to attempt the exploration of the mysterious Roraima!
I suppose, when Carenna found out who you were, she
confessed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Monella, with a half-smile, &ldquo;I made
her do so. People find it difficult to hide anything from
me. I saw she had some secret, and compelled her to
divulge it. But, since she was so afraid to confess to
others, and especially averse to <em>your</em> knowing it, I made
her this promise, that, if you desired to return from our
adventure, you should do so in ignorance of the actual
facts. I was only to tell you in case you freely elected to
stay here permanently. That is why I have kept it back
thus far. I had intended to announce it to you and to the
people at the time of your public betrothal. Then they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
would have received you, with one accord, as one having
a right to rule over them. And now you can understand
why I have regarded you with such affection from the
first; and how glad I was to find, in Apalano&rsquo;s son, one so
worthy of my love and confidence. Your father was allied
with my line, and you are, therefore, akin to me. Worthy
son of a worthy father! Let me join with you in thankfulness
that you have, after all, come into the heritage
that is yours by right! The young eagle was bound to
find its way to the eyrie for which it was best fitted.&rdquo;
And Monella stood up and laid his hand affectionately
upon the young man&rsquo;s shoulder. Leonard reverently bowed
his head, and the other pressed his lips upon his forehead.</p>

<p>There was silence for some seconds. Then Templemore
took Leonard&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And let me too congratulate you, Leonard,&rdquo; he said
fervently. &ldquo;It is good news for you&mdash;this; for, since you
have elected to pass here the remainder of your life, it will
be a great comfort and advantage to you that you have
such good claims and qualifications for the position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thinking about my poor father who died of heartache
and disappointment,&rdquo; rejoined Leonard; and in his
tone there was a note of genuine sorrow. &ldquo;And I can
scarcely forgive Carenna&mdash;fond of me as I know her to
have always been&mdash;for her cruelty to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently Templemore turned again to Monella, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Carenna then believe this mountain was inhabited,
that you would find here the people you came to
seek? Did you yourself think that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to myself, I can scarcely tell you,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Reason&rsquo; said that the hope of finding here the people
of whom Apalano had so often talked to me&mdash;for that was
all I then knew&mdash;was chimerical; yet Apalano&rsquo;s dying
wishes, and some strange sentiment or instinct within me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
urged me on. Then, when I met with Carenna, I found
she quite thought it might turn out true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carenna thought it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; but that is not very surprising, for,
according to the Indian ideas, it would not be the only
instance in this country. There is a belief amongst the
Indians in several parts that some of the unexplored
mountains are inhabited by strange and unknown races.
This applies to those&mdash;and there are many; Roraima is
not the only one&mdash;that are surrounded by the curious belts
of almost impenetrable forest. The Indians believe that,
if these forests could be passed, strange peoples would be
met with living on the mountains thus encircled; and they
say that on clear nights the lights from their fires may
often be seen.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Therefore Carenna was quite prepared
to believe we might find Roraima inhabited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. Then she, at least, will not have been so very
much surprised at our not returning, and may not have
given us up for dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; that is probable enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if she has heard of the signal flares we made
when some Indians&mdash;as I suppose they were&mdash;were camping
in sight of the mountain, she would look upon that as
a sign of our being up here alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that is very likely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is the suggestion of a little comfort in that,&rdquo;
said Templemore; &ldquo;for, otherwise, those I left behind,
and who are dear to me, must have given up all hope and
be now mourning me as dead. With Leonard it is
different. He stood alone in the world and has no one
to grieve for him more than as an ordinary friend.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.<br />

<span class="f8">THE TREE&rsquo;S LAST MEAL.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;And</span> now,&rdquo; said Monella, &ldquo;I have some other news
to give you; for you have slept for nearly two
days, and in that time much has been done. While you
slept we have been busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you <em>never</em> sleep&mdash;yourself?&rdquo; Templemore asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but not for long at a time. However, the long
rest you have taken is no reproach to you, for it was my
doing. I saw that it was needful to restore your strength
and good spirits. You are the better for it; the princess,
the lady Zonella, and others have also had long rests and
are the better for it, as I have already told Leonard.
The king Dranoa, too, is better&mdash;in a sense; for he has
now no mental trouble, and with his sickness there is
no physical pain nor suffering nor distress of any kind.
But he is very wishful now that the marriage of his
daughter should take place as soon as possible; for only
then, he feels, will he be able to die happily. In deference
to his earnest wish I have settled for it to be solemnised
at the end of a fortnight; and, in view of the fact that the
state of his health cannot but be a source of sadness to
his people, I have deemed it better to order that it shall
be a quiet ceremonial, and not a great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i>, as had been
planned. This will not offend your feelings, my son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard looked up with a bright smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;After what you have told me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I feel, with
gladness and gratitude that it is not without reason that
you have so often thus addressed me&mdash;as your son. <em>Now</em>,
I may indeed claim you as a father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may indeed,&rdquo; Monella assented; &ldquo;I take the
place of my lost friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you have no need to ask whether what you
think best pleases <em>me</em>. If you will be my father, choose
for me and instruct me; for I feel I have need of your
help to enable me to take up, and bear worthily, the
position I owe to you. I felt this,&rdquo; continued Leonard,
with great earnestness&mdash;&ldquo;I felt this very strongly when I
lay in that foul den that the poor demented wretch called
&lsquo;the devil-tree&rsquo;s larder.&rsquo; I made then a vow that, if it
should please God to deliver me from the peril that
threatened me, I would thenceforth devote my life to the
good of the people I had come amongst. I repented
sorely that I had given my thoughts too much to selfish&mdash;albeit
innocent&mdash;enjoyment; and I vowed I would not be
guilty of that selfishness in the future, if the chance and
the choice were offered to me. And now that they <em>are</em>,
help me&mdash;instruct me, my father, I pray you, in all that
may enable me to fulfil that vow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella gazed long and fixedly at the young man; and
in his eyes there was a glistening as of a tear. Then he
rose and went to the window that looked out over the
lake, and stood awhile, with a far-off vacant look that
told his thoughts were wandering to distant scenes or
persons. It was some time before he looked round.</p>

<p>And, when he again turned to speak to the young men,
they were both conscious that some indefinable change
had taken place in his manner. His face expressed
unmistakably a great and exalted joy; and the eyes, that
at all times had had so strange a charm in them, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
taken on a new expression. For a little while Templemore
strove in vain to ascertain in what the change consisted;
but presently it seemed to him that they had lost that
half-sad, half-wistful expression he had so constantly
remarked; and that they now conveyed, instead, a sense
of contentment and repose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That which you have now told to me,&rdquo; said Monella,
walking slowly up to Leonard, &ldquo;is as sweet to me as
water to the thirsty in the desert.&rdquo; With grave deliberation
he placed both hands upon the young man&rsquo;s shoulders
and looked into his eyes with fatherly affection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know, my son Leonard&mdash;or rather Ranelda, as you
rightly should be called&mdash;know that in these words you
bring to my soul the message it has been awaiting&mdash;sometimes
in hope, too often, alas! in doubt and in
despair&mdash;through the long ages. Yours is the hand&mdash;the
hand of the son of Apalano&mdash;that bears to me the key of
my fetters; and yours are the lips that announce my
coming freedom! My work, then, nears its end, and
soon&mdash;ay, <em>soon</em>&mdash;I&mdash;shall&mdash;be&mdash;<em>free</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>While uttering these last words Monella raised his
hand, and with upturned face looked rapturously above
him, as if his sight, piercing the marble ceiling overhead,
perceived some far-off scene that, while invisible to his
companions, filled him with the most intense delight.
Presently, he turned away with a regretful sigh, as though
the vision he had been gazing at had vanished, and added,
with an absent manner,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, when I leave you, I shall feel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped; in his eyes there was a far-off look; and
Leonard, who had been looking on with wide-open,
wondering eyes that comprehended little, if anything, of
his discourse, exclaimed in anxious tones,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave me&mdash;leave us! What mean you, my father?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
You surely do not think of leaving the people you so love,
to become again a wanderer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella shook his head; and, appearing to rouse
himself, he replied in quite a different voice,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You misunderstand, my son; I speak of when I shall
be called away&mdash;called from this earthly life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that will not be for a long, a very long time yet,&rdquo;
urged Leonard, looking with confidence at the stalwart
frame, and remembering the many feats of strength the
other had performed.</p>

<p>Monella turned his eyes on Templemore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; he asked, smiling, &ldquo;a conversation
we had one day in the museum; when I explained to you
that no &lsquo;Plant of Life&rsquo; or other specific&mdash;no power, indeed,
of earth&mdash;can keep in its earthly cage the soul that feels
its work is done, and that, therefore, frets itself against
its prison bars?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; answered Templemore in a subdued
tone, and avoiding Leonard&rsquo;s questioning eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! then <em>you</em> understand me. And now&rdquo;&mdash;this with
a gesture that enforced obedience&mdash;&ldquo;now let us go back
to that which we were speaking of. I was saying that
King Dranoa desires that you and Ulama should be
wedded without delay. To spare the feelings of the
maiden, and give her time, so that the matter may not
come upon her too suddenly, I have named a day two
weeks hence. There will be no pageant, no public <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i>;
only the necessary ceremony, quiet and solemn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should prefer it so,&rdquo; murmured Leonard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that is arranged; and it will take place in the
great Temple of the White Priests that has been closed
for so many years. Workmen are engaged upon it, and
it is now being cleansed and renovated. It will be ready
in time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The next thing I have to tell you is that Coryon has
suffered his punishment, and is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coryon dead?&rdquo; the other two exclaimed in a breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; Monella repeated solemnly. &ldquo;It seems
that during the night after we left, there were dreadful
scenes in the amphitheatre. Those large reptiles&mdash;they
are called &lsquo;myrgolams&rsquo; here&mdash;came out of their pool and
attacked the half-dead wretches entangled in the tree.
But the branches tried hard to retain their victims, and
so&mdash;well, you can almost imagine what took place. The
creatures carried off the miserable beings in scraps; tore
them piece by piece from the clutches of the branches till
nothing was left!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and his listeners shuddered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus it came about that the greedy tree was, after
all, baulked of most of its intended victims; all, indeed,
save three or four; though the deaths the others met
with were not less horrible. Yesterday, finding the
monster had no victims in its grasp, I ordered the separating
door to be withdrawn. In a moment, Coryon was
seized and carried up into its awful gorge. With that,
the tale of this terrible tree must end. I have no heart
to devote more criminals to it; though there are some
among the prisoners who are scarcely less guilty than
was Coryon. But these Sanaima will deal with; he will
punish them as seems best to him; and I have set men
to work to dig a mine from one of the cells so as to get
underneath the tree. Then it can be blown up with gunpowder.
And I designed to ask you to superintend the
work for me,&rdquo; turning to Templemore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will gladly do. And&mdash;the&mdash;reptiles?&rdquo;
Templemore was doubtful of the name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kill them off, if you can, with bullets. And now,
to turn to your own affairs. Think not I have forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
them; I know you are anxious and will be getting
restless and unhappy. As I said to you before, when
you go away, you will not go empty-handed. On the
contrary, you will carry with you such riches as will
place you beyond the need of toil for the remainder of
your life. I need not say, &lsquo;Do not therefore be an idle
man,&rsquo; for I know that you will never be. Whenever it
pleases you to go, some of my people shall escort you
through the wood to &lsquo;Monella Lodge,&rsquo; as we called it,
and there await you while you go on to Daranato and
bring back such Indians as you require. Then, do you,
in turn, with your Indians, re-escort my people to the
cavern; for, you must remember, they are not used to
forest life; nor can they, if left alone, protect themselves
against wild animals. Will that please you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, truly it is all I can ask or wish for,&rdquo; Templemore
responded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall wish to know&mdash;that is, all here will wish to
know,&rdquo; said Monella, &ldquo;that you get back in safety to
&lsquo;Monella Lodge.&rsquo; With the heliograph mirror which you
will find packed away at &lsquo;Monella Lodge&rsquo; you can send
us back a message to that effect; then, with the one we
brought here with us, we can reply, and send you a
&lsquo;God speed you&rsquo; to start you on your way. Shall it be so
arranged?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gladly,&rdquo; responded Templemore with emotion. &ldquo;But
must I then resign myself to the thought that I shall
never see Leonard or any of you any more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must,&rdquo; Monella answered quietly, but firmly.
&ldquo;Leonard&mdash;or Ranelda, as I prefer to call him&mdash;has
asked me to guide him and instruct him; and my first
and last advice to him is, and will be, to keep his people
to themselves. Now let us consider this question from
what you yourself would term a practical point of view.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
The term &lsquo;El Dorado&rsquo; has come to be a synonym in the
outside world for a sort of earthly paradise, has it not?
Originally handed down from actual facts and history
relating to this, the celebrated island capital of Manoa&mdash;the
Queen City of my once powerful and extensive
empire&mdash;with the tales of its wonderful wealth and the
virtues of the Plant of Life; its memory lingered through
the ages long after the waters had receded and left it
isolated and unknown. And the Spaniards called it
&lsquo;El Dorado,&rsquo; which has ever since been but another
expression&mdash;as I have said&mdash;for &lsquo;Earthly Paradise,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;summit of every man&rsquo;s ambition.&rsquo; Is it not so? And
seeing that the great curse that so long lay upon the
land has been removed, can you say that <em>now</em> it does not
deserve the term? Have we not here a veritable
&lsquo;Earthly Paradise&rsquo;&mdash;an actual realisation of what you
in the outside world understand when you use the expression
&lsquo;El Dorado?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly I believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah yes! It is so now&mdash;or will be henceforth, when
those who have had such sorrows here shall have outlived
them,&rdquo; said Monella with impressive emphasis. &ldquo;But
what I would put to you, is this; you have, perhaps, seen
something of frontier settlements, or miners&rsquo; camps, and
gold diggings&mdash;at least, <em>I</em> have&mdash;and you have heard of
them. Now, you know well enough that the only people
who would care to brave the hardships of the journey
hither would be those led on by the lust and greed of
gold. Supposing things were reversed, and you were in
Leonard&rsquo;s place, and had here your wife&mdash;as he will have&mdash;your
friends, your own people&mdash;all that was dearest in
the world, with ample wealth, would you care to allow
him, or any one else, to lead people hither, to turn this
&lsquo;El Dorado&rsquo; into a &lsquo;Gold diggings,&rsquo; a &lsquo;Miners&rsquo; camp,&rsquo; with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
all their hideous associations, their gambling and drunkenness;
their rowdyism and their debauchery, their shootings
and murders?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Templemore thoughtfully, &ldquo;you are right
there. Still&mdash;surely, between that, and forbidding intercourse
altogether&mdash;forbidding me even to come to visit
my friend&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monella smiled and gravely shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think that, between the two extremes, there
should be some middle course possible,&rdquo; he rejoined.
&ldquo;Unfortunately&mdash;or fortunately&mdash;there is none. <em>You</em> will
have no need to come here seeking for wealth. You
would not be likely to undertake the expedition alone.
Those who accompanied you would do so from self-seeking
motives. Then, again, you will have other ties; you
will have your wife, children. You do not contemplate
dragging them hither through trackless wastes to greet
friends <em>they</em> have never known as you have? They would
not like it, again, if you, a man of wealth, able to do as
you pleased, were to leave them for a long space while
you made the journey hither alone! And, finally, the
thing is not practical or feasible for another reason. You
will have much ado to find your way out from here. You
know that in these regions vegetation spreads rapidly
unless&mdash;as in the canyon we came up, or in the clearing
immediately outside around the cavern by which we
entered, or out on the savanna&mdash;there are special causes
that check its spread. Should you come back in a
year&rsquo;s time, you would not only find the road we cut
out impassable&mdash;you could not even trace it. The spread
of the undergrowth, the fall of great trees or branches,
the hurling down of rocks from the heights above, floods
from the streams and watercourses&mdash;all these, and other
forces of nature in this wild region, will, within a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
months, have combined to block up or obliterate completely
the path we cut with so much difficulty. Is it
not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear you are right, though it had not occurred to
me,&rdquo; Templemore admitted with reluctance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, again, with the wealth you will take back with
you, you will not care to remain in Georgetown. You
will wish to travel with your wife; in any case, it would
be years before you would be likely to think of undertaking
another journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If ever you <em>do</em>, though, dear old Jack,&rdquo; Leonard
burst in impulsively, &ldquo;if ever circumstances should arise
to make you wish to communicate with me, you can
always do so by the heliograph, you know, or perhaps
by balloon, if I&rsquo;m still alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, though Leonard put on a cheerful tone, it was
easy to see that both he and his friend felt deeply the
severance that too clearly lay before them. Yet, after
Monella&rsquo;s argument, they saw no alternative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am as sorry as you can be,&rdquo; Monella wound up
kindly; &ldquo;but your duties call you away from us, even as
Leonard&rsquo;s call upon him to stay. And now I must leave
you, for many are waiting to see me. First, however&rdquo;&mdash;this
to Leonard&mdash;&ldquo;I will lead you to the princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard followed him from the apartment into another,
where Monella left him; and presently Ulama entered,
looking radiant, lovely, beautiful&mdash;so Leonard thought&mdash;beyond
belief.</p>

<p>At the sight of Leonard, she threw herself upon him
with a joyous cry; with her face upon his shoulder, she
sobbed and laughed by turns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my darling! my darling!&rdquo; she murmured in
gentle accents, &ldquo;if you only knew how <em>glad</em> I am to
see you! I&rsquo;ve had such dreams&mdash;dreams about you&mdash;dreams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
that frightened me so! They <em>were</em> only dreams,
were they not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up anxiously, and fixed her glorious eyes
upon his face, and closely scanned it. Then she gave
a sigh, the token of relief, and once more she nestled
her face upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;after all &rsquo;twas but a dream!
For you look well, and your eyes are bright and happy-looking;
and in my dream you were looking <em>dreadful</em>!
Your poor face looked so thin, and so <em>different</em>, and
your eyes so sunken, and they had dark rings around
them, and oh! their terrible, despairing look! But it
was only a dream, or you could not look well again so
soon, as now you do. Yes, &rsquo;twas but a dream, my
darling! But oh! an <em>awful</em> dream. I thought there
was a great tree&mdash;like that you said you saw one day;
and it was a tree that fed on human beings, and you
were lying bound and they were going to give you to
that dreadful tree! Oh, Leonard, my love, think what
a dream that was for me! Think, for a moment, what
I felt! And there were other dreadful, awful things!&rdquo;
She shivered and cried softly for a space.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my darling,&rdquo; Leonard answered soothingly.
&ldquo;But, as you say, &lsquo;twas but a dream!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! And now it seems far off; for, after it, came
other dreams, that were happy and delightful, so that the
bad one receded ever farther. Just when I seemed even
at the very point of death from horror, a cool hand
pressed tenderly on my brow, and brought me peace.
It seemed to cool the fever that had made me think
my very brain would burst; and a voice said&mdash;oh <em>so</em>
kindly&mdash;&lsquo;Be at rest, my daughter, I bring thee peace,
and surcease of thy sorrow.&rsquo; Then I opened my eyes
and saw a strange form leaning over me. It was dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
in a warrior dress, just like that which stands in our
museum and which is called Mellenda&rsquo;s. Helmet, sword,
everything the same. Then I felt secure and happy, for I
thought the great Mellenda had come to deliver me in my
trouble. But&mdash;and this seems so strange&mdash;when I looked
up at his face, who do you think he was? Ah! you
would never guess! But the countenance was Monella&rsquo;s&mdash;your
friend Monella&rsquo;s! Was not my dream a strange
one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange, indeed, my dear one,&rdquo; said Leonard tenderly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From that moment,&rdquo; went on Ulama, &ldquo;everything
was changed, everything was <em>lovely</em>. It seemed to me
that <em>you</em> then came to me, and led me from that scene
of horror. Where we went I know not; but, hand in
hand, we wandered on, till you led me home. Then once
more things became confused&mdash;I can scarcely remember&mdash;but
I&rsquo;m nearly sure Mellenda seemed to come to me
again. And&mdash;yes&mdash;I remember, he repeated, &lsquo;Rest, my
child; I bring thee rest and peace.&rsquo; Then he left me,
and we wandered on&mdash;you and I, my Leonard&mdash;through
the loveliest, the most entrancing scenes; among places,
people, strange to me, yet all delightful; and, oh, it all
seemed <em>so</em> sweet, so restful, so grateful, after the horror
of that first awful dream! At last I wakened, and they
tell me I have slept through two whole nights and nearly
two whole days! Did you not wonder that you saw me
not the while? Tell me how you have passed your time
without me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And thus the gentle, loving girl talked on with childlike
innocence, Leonard at first evading her inquiries,
averse to mar her happiness by telling her the truth.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was not for some days, and then only by
degrees and carefully guarded words, that he revealed the
truth about her &lsquo;dreams.&rsquo;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />

<span class="f8">THE LAST OF THE GREAT DEVIL-TREE.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Templemore</span> did not find the occupation of directing
the operations for destroying the great devil-tree
a very agreeable or engrossing one. His memories of the
amphitheatre filled him with disgust and loathing both of
the place and of the vegetable monster it contained, and
he never went near them without reluctance; for all that,
he stuck conscientiously to the task now that he had
undertaken it. But there was neither excitement nor
interest in it to keep his thoughts engaged, and to prevent
their brooding upon his desire to get back to those dear to
him. Now that everything was settling down peacefully
in the land, and there was nothing specially to keep him,
he felt he was not justified in prolonging further unduly
his friends&rsquo; suspense. He saw comparatively little, too,
of Leonard, who was continually engaged with Monella
and others in councils and consultations that naturally had
little interest for Templemore; though, no doubt, they
would have been glad enough of his company and assistance
in their deliberations, had he chosen to offer them.</p>

<p>As a consequence, he wandered about a good deal
alone; and took to haunting the spot from which he and
Leonard had made their signal flares, and whence he
could, with his glasses, just distinguish &lsquo;Monella Lodge&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
and the adjacent open country. Here he would sit by the
hour together, wistfully gazing out over the vast panorama
spread beneath him, and moodily watching for the
slightest sign of life in the far distance. Sometimes
&lsquo;Nea,&rsquo; the puma, offered herself as a companion in his
walks; at such times, when he went to the amphitheatre,
he was always in some concern to keep her out of the
reach of the fatal tree, lest she should meet the fate that
had befallen her unfortunate mate.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that he would wait till Leonard&rsquo;s
marriage, since it was so near. But he had determined
not to delay his going more than two days beyond it;
and he now awaited the event with something akin to
impatience. At the same time, he knew that the journey
back to Georgetown would be anything but easy or
agreeable. It had been arduous, difficult, wearisome, and
dangerous enough on the way up, when he had the
company of Leonard with his exhaustless boyish enthusiasm.
What would it be like, he asked himself, going
all that weary road again alone, for he would be alone in the
sense of being the only white man amongst a number of
Indians. Then again, he must return with very little to
show for all the time, and trouble, and danger he had
incurred. Monella, it was true, promised him &lsquo;wealth&rsquo;&mdash;and
no doubt would keep his promise in the form of a
selection of precious stones. <em>They</em> were numerous and
comparatively cheap in the country; so Templemore had
no scruples about accepting such a present. And, when
he reached Georgetown, they would mean wealth. That
was all satisfactory enough; but there was much, very
much more he would have liked to carry away with him;
things of much less intrinsic value, but of greater scientific
interest. Of these there were more than could be
catalogued in a few lines; vessels of gold and silver;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
wonderful antique jewellery, specimens of their armour,
swords, etc., were some; dress-fabrics also; an endless
number of curious botanical and zoological specimens, for
others&mdash;these form only the beginning of a long list of
things he had in his mind, and would have liked to carry
with him. But well he knew the impossibility; the
difficulties of transport were insurmountable. In a country
where it was difficult to get carriers even for the bare food
required, it was obviously useless to dream of carrying
back with him a &lsquo;collection&rsquo; such as he would have wished
to take.</p>

<p>There was natural disappointment in all this. It is
hard for an explorer to face danger, hardship, discomfort;
to separate himself from civilisation and from those he
loves, and to risk illness, fever, wounds and death, and
then, having achieved success, to have to resign himself
to returning without those trophies he would have
delighted in exhibiting to an astonished and wondering
world. But just, perhaps, when he had convinced himself,
by dwelling morbidly upon such thoughts, that he had
good cause for dissatisfaction, his good nature would
assert itself and remind him of the other side to the
picture. Was it a little matter to take back with him
wealth enough to make his mother&rsquo;s future secure and
comfortable; to marry the girl of his heart, and to be
henceforth a man of means and affluence? And if his
part in the expedition ended in such result, had he any
just cause for complaint? Did he not rather owe a debt
of gratitude to those who had urged him on, in spite of
his own scepticism, to share in their enterprise? At this
thought a rush of gratitude would come into Templemore&rsquo;s
mind; then he would torment himself in turn, with
misgivings as to whether he was not guilty of ingratitude
in now feeling impatient to get away from&mdash;to leave for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
ever&mdash;the friends who had thrown such good fortune in
his way.</p>

<p>And thus Jack Templemore felt anything but happy in
the days that preceded Leonard&rsquo;s marriage. And, of
course, he was in love, and felt home-sick; so, perhaps,
it is not much to be wondered at that he was restless and
changeable and ill at ease.</p>

<p>Yet, had he been in a different mood, his stay in the
place might now have been very enjoyable, and of
surpassing interest. He was free to go where he liked
and do as he pleased. The people were not only friendly
and willing and anxious to please, but showed pride and
pleasure, if he but spoke to them. The story of the rescue
of Leonard and the princess had been noised abroad and
told and re-told over and over again, and the part that
Templemore had taken in it was well known. Then,
again, it had also now become known who Leonard really
was; and the people felt that what Templemore had done
for his friend had been done for them, inasmuch as it had
saved for them the life of one who was of their own nation
and whom they now valued highly. Thus Templemore
was regarded as a hero, second only to Monella (or
Mellenda). The people were quite ready to credit him
with qualities he did not possess; for was he not the close
and trusted friend of their own great hero? If Mellenda
had chosen this one from all the people of the outside
world&mdash;for they knew by this time that there <em>was</em> a great
world, outside their mountains, peopled with white races&mdash;must
it not have been for some very good reason?
Must he not be a great man, a hero, a wonder, for the
great Mellenda to have chosen him as his friend and
companion on his return to Manoa?</p>

<p>Thus reasoned the simple-hearted people; and, since it
was also known that he was going away from them for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
ever&mdash;going back to the outer world that was his home&mdash;it
created a sort of mystery about him. Must he not be
some very great man in that world that could not spare
him even to stay and enjoy the friendship and favour of
their own great hero-king?</p>

<p>So they regarded him with an interest and curiosity
almost amounting to awe. Mothers would bring out
their children to look at him as he passed, bidding them
remember, for the remainder of their lives, that they had
once seen the wonderful stranger, the great friend of their
own great hero.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ulama had given herself up zealously to
joining with Leonard in the work he had set himself among
the people. She had been gently and tactfully told the
story of all that had occurred; she knew now that her &lsquo;bad
dream&rsquo; had been only too true. The knowledge cast for
a while its shadow upon her fair face, and she seemed to
lose some of her childish gaiety and to become more staid
under its influence. But it also called into play all the
womanly tenderness and sympathy of her nature. When
she heard of unhappy women and children needing care
and comforting, she eagerly desired to assist in the work
in company with Leonard and Sanaima; and thenceforth
she devoted to it all the time she could spare from attendance
upon her ailing father.</p>

<p>Amongst those in constant attendance on the princess
might now be seen Fernina. She had been brought to
the palace by Sanaima, who had discovered that her
husband was no longer living. The meeting between her
and Leonard was affecting; he presented her to Ulama
and commended the poor woman to her kindness. Ulama
knew now the particulars of the terrible time the two had
passed together in the dread cells within reach of the great
tree, and received her with a heart filled with compassion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
Fernina&rsquo;s gratitude and pride at the kindliness of her
reception were such that they went far to assuage her
sorrows. Her two children also were well cared for, and,
by degrees, the old look of dull misery in her face gave
place to a softer expression that promised to bring back, in
a measure, her former beauty. It was understood that
Fernina would in the future take Zonella&rsquo;s place; for it
had been announced that the latter would shortly be
married to Ergalon.</p>

<p>One day Templemore informed Monella that the mine
had been completed, that he had placed the cask of gunpowder
in position, and laid a fuse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the reptiles?&rdquo; asked Monella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have left them alone&mdash;and for a reason. It seems
to me they are inclined to attack the tree; have done so,
in fact. They are getting hungry and have nothing else
to attack, and, being well penned in, they are beginning
to feed on the only thing within their reach. After all,
the &lsquo;flesh&rsquo;&mdash;if one may so term it&mdash;of a &lsquo;flesh-eating&rsquo;
tree may quite possibly form an acceptable food for these
ugly reptiles when they are starving. If, when we have
blown it up&mdash;or down&mdash;they are disposed to devour it
and so clear it out of the way, it may save some trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then a day was fixed for firing the mine, and a large
crowd of the citizens assembled to witness the destruction
of their enemy; but many, whose memories of the place
were sad, remained away.</p>

<p>When the explosion took place, a long tongue of flame
shot up into the air with a thunderous roar, the great tree
seemed lifted bodily up, swayed, and then fell with a
mighty crash full length on the ground, disclosing a rent
in the trunk from which a thick, noisome stream of dark-coloured
fluid slowly flowed. This gave off an odour so
offensive and over-powering that none could stay in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
enclosure; so the crowd quickly dispersed, with loud
expressions of wonderment and admiration at all that they
had seen. But Templemore remained long enough to see,
from a distance, that the foul reptiles had approached the
tree, and were greedily drinking up the liquid that flowed
from the wound in the trunk. And, visiting the place next
day, he found that they had torn the rent still further
open, and were busily tearing the trunk to pieces, the
branches now showing but feeble signs of life. In the
end they fulfilled his expectations and devoured every
scrap of the monster. Thus ended the existence of the
terrible, horror-laden devil-tree!</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p>It was shortly after he had completed the destruction
of the hated tree that Templemore made a discovery
that filled him with grave uneasiness. He was wandering
about among the heights that lay at one end of the canyon&mdash;that
immediately over the entrance-cavern&mdash;when he
found himself amongst huge blocks which had been
quarried out (as Monella had one day mentioned) with
the idea of precipitating them into the canyon to block
it up impenetrably. On examining the quarry from which
they had been taken, he observed with alarm that some
masses of overhanging rock seemed almost on the point of
giving way. A sort of partial landslip had already taken
place, and there were fresh-looking cracks and fissures that
threatened shortly to loosen the overhanging masses and
set them free to fall into the canyon below. He spoke
to Monella about this, and he at once accompanied him to
the spot, and his opinion confirmed his own. This made
Templemore busy himself in earnest with his preparations
for departure; for he feared that, if these rocks actually
fell, the entrance to the cavern might be so blocked up as
to take long and arduous labour to clear it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>It being now within a day or two of Leonard&rsquo;s marriage
this was all he could do in the matter. But Monella
sent men down the canyon in charge of Ergalon&mdash;since
the latter now knew the road&mdash;to carry in advance
and deposit in the cavern some of the things Templemore
desired to take with him. They returned on the eve
of the wedding, Ergalon stating that all they had taken
down had been duly stored as desired, ready for Templemore
when he went down.</p>

<p>That evening King Dranoa was much better and insisted
on presiding at the evening meal. He even hoped, he
said, to be able to be present at the wedding. Ulama&rsquo;s
joy at this, and the sweet delight that lighted up her face,
were alone enough to infuse happiness into those around
her. She looked at Templemore, too, and smiled and
nodded her head in a mysterious way that roused his
curiosity; and, later, an explanation came.</p>

<p>At the very end of the repast a mysterious-looking dish
or tray, whose contents were hidden by a golden cover,
was brought in with a good deal of ceremony and was
placed before the king. Then Ulama glanced shyly
at Templemore and clapped her hands. At this the king
lifted the cover, and displayed to view&mdash;not some new
eatables, as Templemore had anticipated, but&mdash;a beautifully
fashioned belt, and several exquisitely-worked purses that
all sparkled and flashed with the little diamonds and
other stones that were worked in patterns into the silken
netting. And, when Templemore looked inquiringly at
Leonard, that young man only smiled and nodded mysteriously
like the others.</p>

<p>Then King Dranoa thus addressed him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend, thou hast already heard, I believe, that we
do not purpose to allow thee to depart hence without
begging thine acceptance of some little testimony of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
appreciation of what thou hast done for us. I say we,
for all here&mdash;all in the land indeed&mdash;are deeply in thy
debt. Without thy courageous help and unselfish devotion
my dear daughter would not now be here happy and
joyous as she is to-night, and my kinsman and son-in-law
that is to be would, I fear, only too probably have met a
dreadful fate. Therefore, we have all joined in subscribing
to these presents, of which we beg thy acceptance.
The princess hath worked this belt, and inside it are some
of her own chosen jewels that thou hast often seen her
wear. The lady Zonella, and others of her maidens,
have worked these purses&mdash;they are for thy friends&mdash;and
we have all contributed to their contents. I know naught
about thy world outside, but understand that what is in
these satchels will be of far greater value to thee, and
those dear to thee, than to us here. I truly hope it may
be so; else I should hesitate to offer them, as being but
a poor return for what thou hast done for us. If, however,
they can purchase for thee, in the future, any surcease of
toil, of trouble, of anxiety, then, and only from that point
of view, may they be worth the offering. Take them, my
friend; and may the blessing of the Great Spirit go with
them, and accompany thy footsteps throughout thy
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Ulama took the belt and poured out its contents
upon the tray&mdash;a magnificent, glittering heap of superb
precious stones. Then she emptied each purse in turn,
making other sparkling but smaller heaps. And each
purse had a little label with a name to it; and Templemore
looked on in wonder as the contents of each were
revealed and the names read out by Leonard. There
were three large purses, one for his mother, one for
Maud, and one for Stella. Smaller ones for Mr. and
Robert Kingsford, Dr. Lorien and his son; and two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
still smaller, for Carenna and Matava. No one had been
forgotten.</p>

<p>Templemore looked from the one to the other, his
heart filled with emotion. Even more than the overwhelming
value of the jewels, he felt the loving-kindness
that had thus taken thought and trouble for those dear to
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;Dr. Lorien and Harry&mdash;and&mdash;the others&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
said, hesitating. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The good doctor,&rdquo; Monella explained, &ldquo;will be sorely
disappointed that he cannot come to see us and take back
to the world some of the botanical rarities we have here,
and which, to him, would be great treasures. These are
to console him. As to the others of your friends&mdash;this
is the least we can do to show our regret for the sorrow
and anxiety they will have borne on your behalf, through
us. That is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some minutes Templemore was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too much&mdash;a great deal too much!&rdquo; he got out
presently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then say nothing, dear friend,&rdquo; Ulama interposed,
with a merry laugh. &ldquo;Now let me put them back and
show you how they all fit nicely into the belt. You see,
while you were working for us at that horrid old tree,
we had not forgotten you. Keep the belt always for my
sake, and think of us all lovingly in the future, as we
always shall of you. Now I want you to take me out on
the terrace.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />

<span class="f8">A MARRIAGE AND A PARTING.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> the ancient Temple of the White Priests Leonard
and Ulama were solemnly made man and wife according
to the custom of the country. King Dranoa was able
to be present at the ceremony, and nearly the whole
population may be said to have assisted, for they
thronged in crowds to the great building where in ages
past their kings had all been married; though comparatively
few of the populace could find room inside the
Temple. The remainder filled all the surrounding open
spaces, and waited patiently to greet the bride and bridegroom
on their way back to the palace.</p>

<p>Templemore had a place of honour in the assemblage,
and watched the function with curious interest. Sanaima,
with an array of white-robed priests; Monella, with his
commanding form, conspicuous by his noble bearing; the
beautiful Ulama, all suffused with blushes; and her
handsome bridegroom; the kindly, dignified Dranoa,
looking weak and pale, yet well-pleased and content; and
the brilliant crowd of spectators, officers in gleaming
armour, and courtiers in gorgeous dresses&mdash;all combined
to form a noble pageant. The building, whose interior
Templemore now for the first time saw, was a magnificent
structure, and helped to add grandeur to the
imposing spectacle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>At the conclusion of the ceremony, the procession, on
its way back to the palace, was greeted with excited and
enthusiastic cheers and cries that seemed almost loud
enough to shake the towering buildings past which it
slowly filed.</p>

<p>In the evening there were general feastings and
rejoicings. These were continued till the night was far
advanced; and it was morning ere the city again subsided
unto rest.</p>

<p>The following day, Templemore was busy completing
his preparations, and going round to bid farewell to those
he knew. But, towards the afternoon, he was surprised
to see a large crowd outside the palace; and still more
astonished on learning that the people were gathered in
his honour. The good-hearted citizens, it appeared, liked
not the notion of his going away without some public
mark of the esteem in which they held him; so, somewhat
against his will, he was called out on to the terrace
that overlooked the place in which the people had
assembled. Monella, Ulama, Leonard, and all the
members of the court and of the king&rsquo;s household, stepped
out with him; and the first two each took him by the
hand, and led him to a spot where all could see him.
Then a great shout went up, and he was cheered again
and yet again, till the strange feelings called up by the
unexpected warmth of the welcome he received made him
go red and white by turns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have come for a sight of you, and a word of
farewell ere you leave us,&rdquo; explained Monella. &ldquo;Will
you not give them a few words?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Templemore was unused to oratory, and he would fain
have excused himself; but he saw that to do so would
disappoint his friends. So he made them a short speech,
assuring them of his appreciation of their friendly feelings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The unexpected warmth and kindness you have shown
in thus coming here to-day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall always
gratefully remember. If, in company with the friends
who led me hither, I have done aught that seems to you
to call for commendation, I will only ask you, in return, to
keep for me a tender corner in your memories when I have
left you. If, when I have gone, you will but think as
kindly of me as I shall of you, then indeed I shall be well
repaid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Monella addressed them in his sonorous tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My children, I am well pleased that ye should have
thus gathered here to-day, and of your own accord, to
show to my friend that you are not unmindful of his part
in the events of the past few months. I am glad and
proud that he should receive, before he leaves us, this proof
that my people are not ungrateful to one who hath done
so much for them. A great work hath been accomplished
in the land since we three, as strangers to you all, arrived
some months ago. At the last, its prompt completion was
due in no small measure to your quick response to my
urgent call, at a time when hours were precious&mdash;and even
moments. When I left you in the times long past, I
sailed away with fleets and armies; when returning I was
a simple wanderer. Yet ye gathered gladly at my
summons, and no voice was raised to question my authority.
This was well, and helped me to achieve success; yet
might we have been too late to save the well-beloved of
your princess had not our friend here kept all Coryon&rsquo;s
vile following at bay till we could come to aid him. If the
dread devil-tree exists, to-day, no more, and all the
wickedness and cruelty that went with it have been
trampled out for ever, if now your minds are all at peace,
and your daughters and your other dear ones are secure&mdash;ye
owe much of this to our friend&rsquo;s ready courage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
devotion; and I am rejoiced to see that ye have not forgotten
it!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now will my friend know that he bears away with
him the love and the good wishes of us all. We wish him
all happiness in his future life; our sole regret is that he
cannot stay and spend that life with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this there were shouts and roars of applause, and
other tokens of assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, my children,&rdquo; went on the speaker, &ldquo;I have
somewhat else to say to you. The ancient Temple of the
Great Spirit is once more open; see that ye neglect not to
there offer up your thanks for the blessing that hath been
vouchsafed you. Give heed to the teachings of the worthy
Sanaima. See that ye take to your hearts the precepts
that he will expound to you. So shall the good work that
I have begun be continued and consummated after I shall
have left you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loud murmurs of surprise and objection were here
heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, let not that which I have said arouse your
grief, my children. Remember my long life and weary
wanderings to and fro upon the earth; these have been
a punishment to me, even as events, during this same
time, have been to you. Ye would not wish to keep me
here when I tell you that my task is done, and my tired
soul is seeking rest&mdash;rest not to be found on earth, but only
in the great domain beyond the skies. I may not linger
here now that the work that I was sent to do is finished.
I have freed you from the curse that did oppress you;
have brought you one to govern you who combines within
himself the blood both of your ancient White Priests and
of our kings; and in Sanaima ye have a wise counsellor and
guide. Seek not then to stay me; when the Great Spirit
calleth, weep not and repine not, for then is the hour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
my deliverance. Then shall I be united, at the last, to
my well-beloved queen, my Elmonta, and my children
that have gone before!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Monella ended, he raised his hands and face
towards heaven, and stood gazing upwards like one
inspired. His face seemed transfigured and was lighted
up as by a thrilling joy; and, as on the occasion of his
talk in the palace with Templemore and Leonard a few
days before, he appeared to see something invisible to
those around him, but the sight of which filled him with
supreme content. Then he dropped his arms, looked
around him as though he had just awaked from sleep,
and, with bent head and tardy steps, walked silently
away.</p>

<p>Ulama caught Templemore by the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you think it can be true&mdash;what he says?&rdquo; she
exclaimed in anxious tones, almost a sob. &ldquo;It cannot be
that we are about to lose him? Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I see no cause to apprehend it,&rdquo; was Templemore&rsquo;s
reply. &ldquo;Our friend seems as robust and as strong
as a man can wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! So think I, and yet&mdash;he has spoken in this
strange fashion several times of late. His words fill me
with foreboding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at Templemore with such sorrow in her
gentle eyes that he scarcely knew what to say to comfort
her. And just then he was obliged to leave her to return
the salutes of the people, who were now separating and
returning to their homes or their various callings.</p>

<p>The next morning, shortly after sunrise, Templemore
stood at the top of the hillside, not far from the entrance
of the canyon&mdash;the spot from which he had first seen the
&lsquo;Golden City&rsquo;&mdash;looking his last upon the fair scene
outspread beneath, and saying the last words of farewell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
to his friends. Once more the people had assembled to
do him honour, and they now crowded the slopes on
every side.</p>

<p>Already some of the little party who were to accompany
him to &lsquo;Monella Lodge&rsquo; had started and were on
their way down the canyon, and Ergalon, under whose
charge they were, stood waiting for Jack Templemore.
The latter was surrounded by a little group, of whom
the chief were Leonard, Ulama, and Zonella, who seemed
as if they could not make up their minds to let him go.
Monella, his arms folded, stood apart, gravely looking,
first at the group, and then out over the landscape with
dreamy eyes, his noble figure, outlined against the dark
foliage, the centre of a half-circle of officers and courtiers
who stood respectfully a short distance from him.
Templemore was dressed in the same clothes he had
worn on his arrival; beneath them he had buckled on
the precious belt with the jewels it contained; his rifle
was slung across his shoulder.</p>

<p>Amongst those around were to be seen Colenna and
his son, Abla, and others who had been amongst
Templemore&rsquo;s first friends; and all showed by their
demeanour genuine sorrow at the parting. As a last
and special gift&mdash;one more token of his remembrance
of his boyhood&rsquo;s friend&mdash;Leonard had that morning
handed to Templemore a deed of gift making over all
his property in the &lsquo;outer world&rsquo; to Maud Kingsford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nothing to give, since it is no longer of any
use to me,&rdquo; he observed, with a quiet smile. &ldquo;But,
since I <em>must</em> convey it to some one, let it be a dowry for
Maud in addition to the purse the others send.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would be difficult to say how many &lsquo;last hand-shakes&rsquo;
were given, or how many times Ulama, with
tear-dimmed eyes, pleaded for &lsquo;a minute longer&mdash;just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
a minute,&rsquo; Zonella, with sorrow in her looks, seeming
mutely to second the appeal. But the parting came at last,
and, amid loud huzzas, and the waving of hands and
scarves, and other tokens of good will, Templemore turned
away and, with Ergalon, disappeared into the thicket.</p>

<p>Little was said by either as they made their way
down the rough path, and, even when they rested in
the shade of the half-way cave, neither seemed disposed
for talk. Almost in silence they ate the refreshments
with which the forethought of their friends had loaded
them, and drank cool draughts from the rocky shallows
of the stream.</p>

<p>Suddenly, while they sat within the cave, waiting for
the sun to move so far that the path should be in shade,
a heavy booming detonation like the firing of cannon
burst upon their astonished ears; and they started up
together and stood listening anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth can that be?&rdquo; exclaimed Templemore.</p>

<p>Ergalon gravely shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Falling rock, I think,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If so, it must
be farther down the canyon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us hasten,&rdquo; cried the other, a vision rising before
his eyes of the entrance-cavern blocked, and his being
forced to return. &ldquo;This is what I have been fearing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite the sun, he started off at a rapid pace down the
path, Ergalon following and striving, as well as he could,
to keep up with the other&rsquo;s impetuous movements.
During the remainder of the descent they heard two or
three other similar noises; and at each of these Templemore
hurried on still faster.</p>

<p>When they reached the bottom, they came upon the
little party who had preceded them; they were standing
in doubt and alarm, looking along the valley, which was
already partially blocked by fallen rocks, while more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
continued to fall at intervals, crashing on to those already
fallen and sending up clouds of dust. With the group,
looking on at the scene in a sort of mild surprise, stood
&lsquo;Nea&rsquo; the puma.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stars be praised,&rdquo; Ergalon exclaimed, relieved,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s all at the other end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Templemore in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the rocks have not fallen near your cave,&rdquo; was
the reply. &ldquo;All is clear there,&rdquo; and he pointed to the
hidden cave.</p>

<p>Then there were explanations, and, to Templemore&rsquo;s
dismay, it now appeared that Ergalon had mistaken his
instructions and placed all the things in the wrong place.
He was not really to blame in the matter; for he only
knew of the one cave&mdash;that to which he had accompanied
Templemore when they had come down to fetch the spare
weapons. He knew nothing of any other cavern, and
Templemore had not remembered this.</p>

<p>The situation was a trying and terribly disappointing
one, and Templemore found himself in a grave dilemma.
If he hesitated, it was plain his way would soon be totally
barred. If he went on, and risked being crushed by the
falling rocks, he must go alone; leave behind him everything
he had intended to take with him, save what he had
on his person, and make up his mind to face the dangers
of the gloomy forest by himself! Even now it was almost
folly to risk death or serious injury by making for the
cavern.</p>

<p>Templemore hesitated, the while that more boulders
came crashing down. Then he thought of what it would
mean for him were he to be shut up in the mountain for
an indefinite period. He looked up keenly and saw
enough of what was going on to grasp the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
whole sides of the canyon were crumbling and falling in,
and it looked a sufficient quantity to make it likely that
the reopening of the road would be a work of years. As
that conviction dawned upon him, with a brief word of
farewell he dashed away from the group, and, despite
their startled endeavours to stay him and the entreaties
they called after him, he ran swiftly along the valley
towards the entrance-cavern. After him bounded the
faithful puma; he had no time to give to the attempting
to send her back, and the two went rapidly on, dodging
the great masses that now crashed down faster than
before. A massive boulder rolling down seemed about
to crush them, but they escaped it and disappeared in
a cloud of dust from the view of the spellbound witnesses
of their hazardous race.</p>

<p>Just when they reached the cavern a great stone pitched
upon one already fallen and, splitting into several pieces,
sent heavy fragments flying around in all directions, like
an exploding bomb-shell. One of these fragments struck
Templemore in the back, smashing his rifle, and throwing
him, stunned and bruised, upon the floor of the
cavern.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV.<br />

<span class="f8">JUST IN TIME!</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">At</span> sunrise, one morning, a fortnight after the events
recorded in the last chapter, a party of travellers,
consisting of three white men and a number of Indians,
set out from the Indian village of Daranato, making their
way in the direction of Roraima.</p>

<p>The three white men were Dr. Lorien, his son Harry,
and Robert Kingsford; and among the Indians was
Matava. As they toiled along the rough path it was
easy to see that the travellers were, for the most part,
travel-worn and weary; they moved forward in a half-listless
fashion, scarcely looking to right or left, and
showing but little interest in the scenes that lay along
their route. Only when they came to the ridge from
which the first view of Roraima is to be obtained did
any of the party exhibit curiosity. Here a halt was
made, and they all gazed for some time silently at the
great mass that raised itself high above the surrounding
landscape. This morning, clouds hung over it and it
appeared sombre, dark and threatening, and gave no sign
of the fairy-like lightness and beauty it sometimes
assumed when seen from this same spot.</p>

<p>Robert Kingsford had come up from the coast, in the
company of the doctor and his son, bent upon solving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
if possible, the mystery that surrounded the fate of the
two friends who had left Georgetown, nearly nine
months before, to join with an unknown stranger in the
exploration of Roraima. All that had since been heard
of them was the strange, almost fantastic account that had
been brought back by Matava, according to which they
had actually found a way into the mountain, and thenceforth
had disappeared. The very entrance by which they
had made their way through the solid wall of cliff had
been afterwards found fast sealed; and no trace or clue to
their fate had been left behind. This had been Matava&rsquo;s
account, and he had not hesitated to express his belief that
the three adventurers had been captured by the demons of
the mountain, and either eaten up then and there, or kept
as prisoners and slaves in durance vile.</p>

<p>This story, however, did not satisfy the minds of the
others, and Robert Kingsford, seeing and compassionating
the deep sorrow of Templemore&rsquo;s widowed mother, and
the still more passionate grief of his own sister Maud,
determined to investigate matters for himself. Dr. Lorien
was detained longer in Rio than he had expected;
but, when at last he returned to Georgetown, he
readily joined the other in the proposed expedition of
inquiry.</p>

<p>They had a very arduous and difficult journey up
from the coast. It happened to be a season of exceptional
drought, and cassava, and food of all kinds, were extremely
scarce. The sun had been unusually fierce, and the heat
abnormal; hence, by the time they reached Daranato,
even the sturdy and seasoned doctor&mdash;a very veteran
in tropical travel&mdash;was nearly worn out; while the other
two were in still worse plight.</p>

<p>Add to these trials the fact that they had little, if any,
hope of succeeding in their quest, and felt, in reality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
that the expedition was, at best, but a sort of forlorn
hope; and it will be understood why they had started
from Daranato dispirited and depressed.</p>

<p>Thus, when they obtained their first view of the
mysterious mountain, the cause of all their trouble, they
were not inclined to regard it with any very friendly
feelings; and its gloomy, forbidding look this morning
was reflected, so to speak, in their own minds. &ldquo;There
is our enemy,&rdquo; they felt. &ldquo;There is the fascinating,
sinister chimera that has bewitched, and lured away from
us, our dear friends, and caused us all this anxiety and
useless trouble.&rdquo; And so, as Roraima frowned upon
them, they frowned back, and returned in kind its gloomy
and unfriendly greeting.</p>

<p>But frowns and angry looks could do them no good; so
the travellers, with a very few words of comment, continued
their route towards &lsquo;Monella Lodge,&rsquo; where they
arrived towards evening.</p>

<p>Here, a mile or so from the &lsquo;haunted wood,&rsquo; and
almost, as it seemed to them, under the very shadow
of the mighty towering walls, they set about making
arrangements for a stay of several days. They found
everything in the cabin much as Matava had led them
to expect; the place, indeed, just as Templemore had
left it at his last visit. Many things had been left there
that the travellers now found useful, and that seemed
veritable luxuries after the discomforts of their long
journey.</p>

<p>Kingsford&rsquo;s thoughts were intent upon his missing
friends; and, indeed, this was also the case in only a
slightly less degree with the other two. All were
oppressed with vague suspicions of the Indians, even of
Matava. Might these not have murdered the three
travellers for the sake of the things they had with them&mdash;articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
and stores which would be as priceless treasures
to Indians; therefore which might quite conceivably have
offered a temptation too great to be resisted?</p>

<p>However, amongst the tribe at the village, they had
seen no signs of &lsquo;white men&rsquo;s&rsquo; belongings to any unusual
extent; and, now that they saw what a number of
things had been left undisturbed in &lsquo;Monella Lodge,&rsquo;
their suspicions were very considerably lightened. For
all that, they found it difficult to believe implicitly the
fantastic tale Matava had told about the three adventurers&rsquo;
disappearance.</p>

<p>The Indians gathered wood and lighted fires, while
the white men made a careful and interested inspection
of the contents of the habitation and its surroundings
(the two llamas had been removed to the village, where,
however, they had both since died). Inside, they found
a lamp and a small cask still partly full of oil, which was
a discovery they appreciated when it grew dark.</p>

<p>After their evening meal, the three friends sat for
some time smoking their pipes and discussing the strange
situation in which they found themselves. They were
now within reach of their journey&rsquo;s end. If the tale
told by Matava were correct, and the road through the
forest were still fairly clear, they ought to be able to
reach the mysterious cavern the next day; when they
were determined, if requisite, to blow open the entrance
with gunpowder. In addition to that which they had
brought with them, they had found a considerable quantity
at &lsquo;Monella Lodge.&rsquo; This surprised them; for in this
country gunpowder is more valued by Indians than
almost anything else.</p>

<p>The three friends were sitting talking, and were thinking
of retiring to rest for the night, when Matava came
rushing excitedly into the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Come quickly, my masters,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Come!
Come and see the light on the mountain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somewhat languidly those addressed rose and went
out. They had so often heard the usual stories of lights
seen at night on unexplored mountains that they attached
but little importance to them. They had treated in like
manner a statement by Carenna and Matava that some
Indians, camping out on the savanna a few months
before, had seen strange and unusually bright lights,
that they took to be signals, on Roraima&rsquo;s summit. The
Indians had been scared and broke up their encampment
at once, fearing the lights might have been placed there to
lure them into the power of the demons of the mountain.</p>

<p>When, however, the doctor stepped outside, and looked
up towards the top of the stupendous precipice, he saw a
brilliant flame that had all the appearance of a signal
beacon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like a forest fire,&rdquo; he said to Kingsford,
while they were examining it carefully through their field-glasses.
&ldquo;And now and then I almost fancy I can make
out human forms passing in front of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others had the same impression, and Harry Lorien
declared he could see flashes of light, as though the beings
round the fire were dressed in clothes, or carried something,
that reflected the firelight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us try burning a little powder,&rdquo; the doctor suggested,
&ldquo;after the fashion Matava says was arranged
between him and the others, but which they never carried
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they sent Matava for the powder, and told him to
fire it in the manner that had been settled between him
and Monella. It is true none of the three messages agreed
upon would be applicable to the present occasion&mdash;but
that they could not help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently, three tongues of flame leaped up into the air,
then suddenly died out, leaving those around temporarily
half-blinded by the glare. Then they stood for some time
anxiously watching through their glasses.</p>

<p>What seemed a long interval ensued; when, suddenly,
three brilliant gleams flashed out on Roraima&rsquo;s height, in
exact imitation, as to the intervals between the flashes, of
the signals they had themselves made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try another,&rdquo; Doctor Lorien cried, in growing excitement.
&ldquo;Arrange the three differently this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was done, and the answering flashes came back,
again in exact imitation; and this time with scarcely any
delay.</p>

<p>Doctor Lorien seized Kingsford by the hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven be praised for this!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his voice
half-choked with emotion. &ldquo;It begins to look, indeed, as
though Matava&rsquo;s account were true; as if our dear friends
may be alive after all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Words cannot describe the delight with which the travel-worn
party hailed these signs, that so unmistakably pointed
to the conclusion suggested in the doctor&rsquo;s words. There
was one thing, certainly, they could not understand; none
of the signals agreed upon between Monella and Matava
had been given from the mountain; but they were inclined
to attribute this to Matava&rsquo;s having, after the lapse of
time, forgotten or mixed up what had been arranged.
Only the thought that their supply of powder was not
unlimited restrained them from continuing the signalling;
but they were reluctantly compelled, as a matter of
prudence, to discontinue it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;we can attack the &lsquo;haunted
wood&rsquo; with a good heart. Surely, our friends will come
down to meet us, now that they know we are here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before daylight they were all astir, and set off at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
on the journey through the forest, Matava guiding them.
The road, or track, was followed with difficulty, and was
almost blocked at times. Only an Indian&rsquo;s instinct, indeed,
could have made it out. In places the rough temporary
bridges that had been made over water-courses had been
washed away, but, the water being very low from the long-continued
drought, this caused no serious difficulty. They
met with some adventures by the way, which were,
however, suggestive of the dangers that lay around them
rather than important in themselves. At last, towards
evening, Matava told the doctor they were getting near
the cavern. And now he begged him to proceed with
caution. He could not get over the fear that the &lsquo;demons
of the mountain&rsquo; had eaten up or captured their friends,
and were now awaiting more victims whom they had
lured on by imitating and answering the signals of their
murdered friends.</p>

<p>This theory did not find much favour with the doctor;
for all that he so far yielded to the entreaties of the Indian
as to send him on to scout in advance, while he, and the
others of the party, walked in silence behind. And,
since Matava now moved with especial care, they made
slow progress.</p>

<p>As it happened, however, Matava&rsquo;s caution was in a
measure justified; for just when they came to the part
where there was an opening in the trees, and they could
see ahead of them the light that came down into the
clearing round the cavern, Matava stopped and raised his
hand.</p>

<p>All stood still, except the doctor, who moved up to the
Indian&rsquo;s side and looked whither he was pointing.</p>

<p>For a moment or so he could see nothing to account
for the other&rsquo;s behaviour. To the right the stream that
came out of the rock was now plainly in sight; and ahead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
of them was the clearing. The entrance to the cavern was
as yet hidden by intervening trunks, but the light-coloured
rock could be seen between the trees. Matava slowly
raised his rifle and took a careful aim; then, as though
dissatisfied, he lowered the weapon and stood with
up-lifted hand enjoining silence upon those behind him.
To make sure, he turned round and, with many gestures,
impressed upon them all to keep motionless and silent;
then, having satisfied himself that they understood and
would obey his signs, he faced round and again raised his
rifle.</p>

<p>And now, Doctor Lorien, following the line of the
Indian&rsquo;s aim, became conscious of a slight movement
among the trees in front of them. Presently&mdash;the Indian
still waiting his opportunity to fire&mdash;he saw that a great
hanging mass was swaying to and fro, passing and
re-passing the space between the trunks of two trees.
At first he thought it was a large mass of hanging creeper,
but, remembering that there was no wind to cause the
movement, he looked more closely and saw that it was the
head and part of the body of a gigantic serpent that was
depending from a branch above. Suddenly, Matava&rsquo;s
rifle rang out, and a moment after an enormous mass fell
to the ground and writhed and twisted about in horrible
contortions.</p>

<p>Then a loud, hoarse roar was heard, echoing through
the forest. The startled travellers looked about on every
side, but could see nothing to explain the sound; then it
came again and again, while the colossal folds in front of
them, half hidden by the trees, continued to rise and fall,
lashing against the trees and shrubs with blows that
seemed almost to shake the ground.</p>

<p>Matava advanced and fired other shots into the struggling
monster; then, watching his opportunity, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
a rush and dexterously cut off the creature&rsquo;s head with a
blow of his axe.</p>

<p>And now, looking towards the rock, they saw the
&lsquo;window&rsquo; entrance to the cavern, and the head of the big
puma from which had proceeded the loud roars they had
heard; and by the side of the puma was a pallid, thin,
haggard face that they had some difficulty in recognising
as Jack Templemore&rsquo;s!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have come only just in time,&rdquo; he said, in a weak
voice, with a poor attempt at a smile, when the doctor
had come near. &ldquo;We were almost done for; at least, I
know I am. I scarcely know whether I have strength
enough to get the ladder out for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They tied two lassoes together and threw one end in;
this he fastened to the ladder, and, thus assisted, it was
got out. Immediately the puma sprang down it and
disappeared into the forest. Then the doctor, followed
by Kingsford and Harry, climbed up and entered the
cavern, to find Templemore lying on the floor unconscious.</p>

<p>He was suffering from a sprained ankle and a badly
bruised arm, and was exhausted from want of food. It
was some time before he could explain matters to his
rescuers; and they, meantime, were anxiously wondering
at finding him thus alone, with no sign about of his two
friends. When he had briefly accounted for their absence,
he told how he had been kept prisoner for more than a
week by the great serpent that, all that time, had relentlessly
watched and waited outside. But, apart from this,
he could scarcely have got through the wood in his
crippled state.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but for that serpent, &lsquo;Nea,&rsquo; the puma,
would have brought in some fresh meat. As it is, I have
had to share with her even the small amount of tinned
food we happened to have left here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>The flying pieces of rock that had injured him had
broken his rifle; and he had only a few cartridges for
his revolver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all been unfortunate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They put all
the things in the wrong cave, and, when I came to myself
after my desperate race between the falling rocks, I was
in darkness and the puma was licking my hands and face.
With much difficulty I found my way to the front here
and pulled the stone away; then found a lantern and
some oil, and got a light. The entrance to the canyon I
found was all dark&mdash;buried&mdash;and I could still hear
rumblings as of further falls of rock; but they sounded
distant. I imagine, therefore, that the valley must be
buried pretty deep. I set about making myself as
comfortable as I could; and, when I put the ladder out,
&lsquo;Puss,&rsquo; as I call her, went out hunting while I bathed my
ankle and arm. Several days she went out and brought
in something pretty regularly, and I thought I should
be able to nurse myself up and get well enough to
struggle through the wood alone. But, one morning,
she refused to go out; that day I had a visit from a
pack of &lsquo;Warracaba tigers&rsquo;; another time when she
stayed in, looking out myself, I saw that awful serpent
hanging from a bough; and there it has been day and
night ever since; &lsquo;Puss&rsquo; refusing to venture forth. I fired
all my cartridges, except two, at it without any effect.
It kept ceaselessly swaying its head about, and my arm
pained me and my hand trembled; and, unless you can
put a bullet through its head, it&rsquo;s of no use firing at a
creature like that, you know. If my rifle had been all
right, the thing would have been easy enough. I kept
two cartridges in reserve&mdash;one for poor &lsquo;Puss&rsquo; and the
other for myself&mdash;and I think you came only just about
in time to save us both.&rdquo; And Jack&rsquo;s voice shook, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
he felt a choking sensation in his throat. It was clear
he had given up hope and had been making up his mind
to face death alone.</p>

<p>Robert Kingsford&rsquo;s gratification and delight in the fact
that his journey had, after all, turned out to be the
means of rescuing his friend, the lover of his sister, may
be imagined. Nor were the others less pleased; only
the good doctor&rsquo;s satisfaction was clouded by his inability
to get out into the wonderful valley to obtain any of the
botanical treasures that lay so near at hand. But his
chagrin disappeared when Templemore, as some consolation,
showed him the purse of gems that had been sent
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give up orchid-collecting after this, lad!&rdquo; he
exclaimed to his son. &ldquo;No need to wear out my old
bones any longer in toilsome wanderings, when we&rsquo;ve
got enough to live on comfortably without.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently, &lsquo;Puss&rsquo; came back with a wild pig, and great
was the rejoicing over the meal that followed.</p>

<p>Then all, save Templemore&mdash;who could only look on
from the window&mdash;went out to examine the reptile
monster they had killed and to gaze in astonishment at
its huge proportions. The Indians had already begun
to skin it, but had not finished the operation when the
time came for making their preparations to pass the
night.</p>

<p>These were complete&mdash;the four white men sleeping in
the cavern and the Indians bivouacking outside&mdash;when
strange cries were heard echoing through the forest.
Instantly there was a great stir among the Indians.
With one accord they started up, exclaiming, &ldquo;The
tigers! The tigers are coming!&rdquo; Forgetting their fear
of the &lsquo;demons&rsquo; cavern,&rsquo; they cried out piteously for
the ladder to be put out for them; and no sooner was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
this done than they scrambled up it with all speed into
the cave, and pulled it in after them.</p>

<p>In reply to the amazed inquiries of the others, Matava
explained that they had recognised the distant trumpetings
of &lsquo;Warracaba tigers,&rsquo; those fierce animals that
nothing&mdash;not even fires&mdash;can stay or keep at bay. Soon,
in fact, the animals could be heard on all sides around the
cavern, though but little could be seen of them in the darkness.
Their growls and roars and squeals were answered
by hoarse roars of defiance from the puma that were
deafening as they reverberated through the galleries of the
cavern. Outside, the &lsquo;tigers&rsquo; made frantic efforts to leap
up and get in at the window, while those within had much
ado to keep the puma from leaping out amongst them.
They also fired a few shots at them, but in the darkness&mdash;for
the fires had burned low&mdash;they were fired at random.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;I should think there must be
a hundred of them! What an awful place this forest must
be! I know that wolves hunt in packs, but I never before
heard of &lsquo;tigers&rsquo; doing so. Wolves can&rsquo;t climb trees as
these can. It&rsquo;s awful, perfectly awful!&rdquo; he added, the
while he listened to the diabolical noises going on outside.
It was, indeed, as a former traveller has expressed it, &lsquo;like
a withering scourge sweeping through the forest.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>It was hours before the din died down; and then, just
when the tired travellers were falling asleep, the most
appalling, human-like cries broke forth, sounding first
quite close at hand, and then dying away in a long-drawn
wail or shriek.</p>

<p>Again the new-comers started up in alarm; but Templemore,
smiling feebly, bade them take no notice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only the &lsquo;lost souls&rsquo;,&rdquo; said he.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;lost souls&lsquo;!&rdquo; exclaimed Kingsford. &ldquo;What
can you mean?&rdquo; He began to think the other must be
raving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know no more than you do,&rdquo; was Templemore&rsquo;s
reply. &ldquo;So the Indians account for those sounds, and
that is all I can tell you. Since I have been here they have
serenaded me thus every night&mdash;even sometimes by day&mdash;and
at times I have thought all the &lsquo;lost souls&rsquo; from the
Infernal Regions must have been let loose for my especial
entertainment&mdash;or to frighten me to death or drive me
mad&mdash;I know not which. I really think, if I had not had
the company of this faithful beast&mdash;she always roars back
defiance at them&mdash;I <em>should</em> have gone mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Towards morning the sounds ceased, and sleep became
possible for two or three hours. But when, at daylight,
the Indians rose and ventured out, they found the great
snake had been almost completely devoured. Only some
bones and a few bits of skin were left.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />

<span class="f8">THE END.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Templemore</span> was carried, with much difficulty, to
&lsquo;Monella Lodge,&rsquo; where an attack of fever supervened,
and it was nearly two weeks before the doctor
pronounced him out of danger.</p>

<p>Carenna came over from her village to nurse him, and
tended him as devotedly as she had Leonard. In the
height of the fever he raved constantly of the great
devil-tree, of gigantic serpents, of Monella, and of &lsquo;lost
souls&rsquo;; and, mixed up with all, were a number of names
strange to those who listened to him; for he had been too
ill when found in the cavern to give more than a brief idea
of the adventures he had passed through.</p>

<p>While he lay upon his bed of sickness, anxious friends
watched from the mountain top for tidings of his fate, but
received no intelligible answers to their signals; for none
of those now with Templemore knew how to reply to
them. Thus it was not till he was convalescent and well
enough to be taken out into the open air, that any interchange
of messages became possible.</p>

<p>Those below, looking up, day after day had seen
little flashes of light, of which they could make nothing;
but now Templemore explained their meaning. A search
in the cabin brought to light the mirror Monella had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
thoughtfully packed up and hidden carefully away; and
Templemore was thus able at last to open communication
with his Roraima friends.</p>

<p>His first signalled message to them brought back the
reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquo1">

<p>&ldquo;<i>Heaven be praised! We are all so thankful! We
have mourned you as dead! And we are in great affliction,
besides, for Monella, the great, great-hearted Mellenda,
is dead! He died peacefully the day after you went away.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Then, presently, when Templemore had sent back a
message of sorrow and condolence, another came.</p>

<div class="blockquo1">

<p>&ldquo;<i>The whole valley at the bottom of the canyon is half-filled
up. It would take years to clear it. And we pictured you
as lying dead beneath it all!</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Many messages passed to and fro during the remainder
of the travellers&rsquo; stay; and then, after a time, Templemore
having thoroughly recovered, preparations were made for
the journey back to the coast.</p>

<p>Both Carenna and Matava were grieved at the thought
that Leonard had remained on the mountain for good, and
that they were never likely to see him more. Carenna,
alone, however, expressed no surprise. She told Templemore
that the deception as to Leonard she had practised
upon the good people who had received them so
hospitably in their lonely mountain retreat had, all her
life, been a sore trouble to her. It was some consolation
to her, therefore, to know that he had, after all, been led
back to his own people. She at first refused the valuable
present Leonard had sent her, saying that to receive
forgiveness was in itself more than she had hoped for.
But, needless to say, Templemore persuaded her into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
accepting it. Matava&rsquo;s delight with what had been sent
him was unbounded; especially when Templemore told
him what treasures he could purchase with it: rifles,
pistols, unbounded supplies of powder, and unlimited
tobacco, and other things that Indians prize.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Doctor Lorien and his son had been
assiduous in collecting specimens of all the botanical and
zoological treasures with which the neighbourhood of
Roraima abounds; and, when the time for starting came,
they had good reason to be satisfied with the result.
They might have done still better, perhaps, if they had
gone more into Roraima Forest; but this they could not
make up their minds to do. Indeed, they could not
venture far without an Indian guide; and this they could
not get. Neither Matava nor any one of the other
Indians could be prevailed upon to go into the wood
again; and even the doctor was not very pressing.
All had had quite enough of the &lsquo;haunted wood.&rsquo; For it
now came out, too, that Templemore had become a
believer in the &lsquo;didi.&rsquo; He declared that more than once
during his imprisonment in the cavern he had seen, either
at early morning or at dusk, strange human-like shapes&mdash;gigantic
apes&mdash;standing watching within the shadow
of the trees.</p>

<p>Nothing, he said, would induce him to enter that wood
again. And he felt certain that only the fact that the
entrance to the cavern was so high from the ground had
enabled him to escape with his life.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Nea,&rsquo; the puma, alone showed no fear of the gloomy
forest. She went hunting there daily, and nearly always
returned with something to reward her enterprise.</p>

<p>When all was ready for the start, two or three last
messages passed between the travellers and their friends
upon the mountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Heaven keep you and all those dear to you! Your
memory will always be cherished by all here</i>,&rdquo; came from
Leonard. To which Templemore replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Long life and happiness to you and your dear wife and
all your people.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>God bless you, Jack!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>God bless you, Leonard!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus they finally parted; and a few hours later the
homeward-bound friends looked their last upon Roraima
from the ridge near Daranato. The mountain was lighted
with the red rays of the setting sun and towered up in
glowing splendour. The greens of the wood at its base,
varied and vivid in colouring, as they were, contrasted
with the pinks, and purples, and reds of the precipitous
walls above, that now looked again like a fairy fortress in
the clouds, smiling, and fascinating in its light, aerial
beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pity the city does not show!&rdquo; said Harry.
&ldquo;What a glorious sight it would make!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least you have conquered the secret the mysterious
mountain has so long and so well concealed,&rdquo; Doctor
Lorien observed to Templemore.</p>

<p>The latter gazed on the mountain gloomily. His
mind went back to the morning when he saw it first
and the vague forebodings that had then come into his
mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said doubtfully. &ldquo;I have not
brought away with me the most wonderful secret of all&mdash;the
&lsquo;Plant of Life.&rsquo; When I think how I was cheated out
of that, by the mountain itself, as you may truly say&mdash;for
its very rocks came crashing down to prevent my escape,
or to kill me if I persisted; or at least, to insure my
leaving nearly everything behind&mdash;when I think of this,
it seems to me that Roraima has guarded most of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
secrets pretty effectually, and I am almost persuaded
there is something uncanny about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry laughed at this; the more so that it came from
Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very fanciful&mdash;for you,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;If it
had been Leonard, now, I should not have been surprised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid my ideas of what is precisely practical
and what is fanciful have been a good deal modified,&rdquo; Jack
confessed. &ldquo;So would yours, if you had passed through
my experiences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, after all, perhaps you haven&rsquo;t lost much,&rdquo; Harry
returned. &ldquo;A small bundle of dried plants wouldn&rsquo;t have
been of much use, and as to the seeds, if, as I understand
you, they only thrive high up on the mountains, I don&rsquo;t
see what you were going to do with them. Moreover,
very likely they would have been eaten up by insects,
or lost, or got wetted and spoiled, or something, before
you got back or could have planted them in a likely
spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they continued their journey, staying that night
in Daranato, where the great puma at first created a scare
among the dusky inhabitants, but, showing friendliness
towards all, she was soon the object of unbounded wonder
and interest on every side.</p>

<p>Some two months later there was again a little dinner
party at &lsquo;Meldona,&rsquo; Mr. Kingsford&rsquo;s residence, and the
same faces were gathered round the hospitable board&mdash;all
but Leonard Elwood&rsquo;s. Maud looked charming and
happy as she glanced, now and again, first at Jack
Templemore&rsquo;s bronzed face, and then at her brother,
listening, not for the first time now, to her lover&rsquo;s wondrous
tale.</p>

<p>She and Stella had shuddered before at the accounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
of the great tree and its victims, and of the horrors of
the &lsquo;haunted wood&rsquo;; and had talked of Ulama and
Zonella, and wondered, again and again, what they were
like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Leonard! I am sorry to lose him,&rdquo; Maud said.
&ldquo;Yet, I suppose, he does not need pity; for he is to be
envied in many ways. Fancy his dreamings&mdash;about which
we used to tease him so&mdash;coming true after all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is just a year ago to-day,&rdquo; observed Mr. Kingsford
to the doctor, &ldquo;that you were at dinner here and first
told us about that wondrous stranger, Monella. We&rsquo;ve
had an anxious time ever since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never known a happy moment till you all
came back the other day,&rdquo; said Maud sadly. &ldquo;I am so
thankful that the cruel suspense is ended at last. I have
often recalled the words Dr. Lorien used about Roraima;
that &lsquo;its very name had come to be surrounded by a
halo of dread and indefinable fear.&rsquo; I can truly declare
that it has been so with me. I, too, had come to hate
and dread the very name. It has seemed to me like a
great, remorseless ogre that had swallowed up two of
our friends, and, as I feared, was going to swallow up
my brother and two more. Yet,&rdquo; she added, looking at
Jack, &ldquo;had I known how things really were, had I
known of your lying lamed, and ill, and alone in the
den in that horrible forest, I think I should have gone
mad! What a comfort to you this dear, faithful animal
must have been!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nea&rsquo; was by her side, and she put her tear-stained
face affectionately down to the animal&rsquo;s head. The big
puma had already established herself as a favourite with
every one in the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; returned Jack, &ldquo;such thoughts occurred to
me while I was cooped up there. I couldn&rsquo;t help going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
over things in my mind; and, when I considered how
the mountain itself, and all the horrors of the forest,
seemed to have combined against me to prevent my
escape, I was seized with a sort of hate and detestation
of the place. And, ever since, my sleep has been
disturbed&mdash;and will be for years to come, I feel convinced&mdash;by
nightmare dreams of the sights and sounds that
haunt my memory!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel that I have a grudge against it, too,&rdquo; the
doctor avowed. &ldquo;Consider all the wonderful things you
have told us that are to be found inside! Then, just when
I got so near, to be shut out in that way! That &lsquo;Plant
of Life,&rsquo; too! I&rsquo;d have given a good deal to have some
specimens of that, and some seeds. <em>I</em> would have got
them to grow, somehow, if the thing could be done!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m precious glad, then, that you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the irreverent
Harry put in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping to be a physician&mdash;one day&mdash;remember!
And what chance would there be for me
and the rest of the profession, if you taught people how
to live for hundreds of years without so much as an
illness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This very unexpected view of the matter from the
vivacious &lsquo;budding doctor&rsquo; had the effect of turning the
thoughts of the others from the somewhat gloomy channel
into which they seemed to have drifted.</p>

<p>After dinner, the belt, and the purses, and their
glittering contents, were brought in and spread out to
view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever else may be said,&rdquo; Mr. Kingsford declared,
with emotion, &ldquo;there is not one here who will not have
cause to remember the stranger Monella, and Leonard,
and their friends, with grateful feelings. And you, Jack,
above all; for, if I am any judge of the value of your share
of these things, you are a millionaire. And that brings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
back to my mind the thought that is now constantly
perplexing me, Who <em>was</em> this wondrous Monella after all?
I really cannot bring myself to believe he was&mdash;what
was his name?&mdash;Mellenda, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; assented the doctor. &ldquo;As a man, I have the
greatest liking and respect for him; but, as a scientist, I
am bound to disbelieve in that part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since I have no claim yet to be considered a scientist,&rdquo;
said Harry, &ldquo;I suppose I am free to believe what I like.
So I go the whole ticket. I believe he was what I first
pronounced him to be&mdash;a magician&mdash;and&mdash;I swallow the
Mellenda legend&mdash;whole! So there!&rdquo; This very emphatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, <em>yes</em>!&rdquo; Stella exclaimed, her blue eyes opening
wide at the doubting ones. &ldquo;Why, of course, it <em>must</em> be
true. It is so much more romantic and poetic, you know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said, very decidedly. &ldquo;I honour and respect
the man, and his memory, from all I have heard of him,
but&mdash;I cannot accept that wonderful part of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, <em>I</em> do,&rdquo; Maud exclaimed, looking round with a
pretty air of defiance, more particularly directed against
Jack. &ldquo;So that makes opinion even, so far&mdash;three for,
and three against. Now,&rdquo; to Templemore, &ldquo;of course, I
know <em>you</em> will side with the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To every one&rsquo;s surprise, however, Jack also shook his
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; he answered, with a comically
bewildered air. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve really had all my old notions so
mixed up and blown about, that I honestly admit I really
cannot make up my mind. The whole thing is an enigma
that I cannot solve as yet&mdash;probably never shall. So you
may put me down as neutral&mdash;undecided&mdash;whatever you
like to call it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>Maud clapped her hands; and upon that the puma gave
a loud roar, evidently signifying <em>her</em> assent and approbation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three for, three against, and one neutral,&rdquo; Maud cried
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better than I hoped for!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor laughed, and his good-natured eyes
twinkled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve all but beaten us,&rdquo; he said good-humouredly.
&ldquo;But, going away from that part of the subject, I feel
truly sorry to think that he should have died so soon after
he had accomplished the work he had had so much at
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There again I am inclined to differ,&rdquo; Templemore
answered slowly. &ldquo;I honestly believe that nothing could
have happened to please him more. All his later talk
clearly showed that. He said he was utterly weary of
life, and anxious to be &lsquo;released,&rsquo; as he called it; yet his
love for his people was so great, he let no sign of
this appear till he felt sure all had been finally achieved.
It was the fear that that work might be upset after
he had gone&mdash;and that alone&mdash;that made him so anxious
to shut out all future communication with the world
outside; of that I feel convinced. It was that that
influenced him too, I have no doubt, in making me
promise to keep my adventures there a secret from the
world in general. But, just at the last, almost when
I was coming away, a doubt seemed to come into
his mind, and he said to me, &lsquo;I release you from that
promise, if circumstances should arise in which you conscientiously
believe it would be conducive to the good of
my country to tell the story of your sojourn here.&rsquo; What
he meant I cannot conceive; I only tell you what he said.
Possibly time may show. He seemed to have the &lsquo;gift of
prophecy&rsquo; to some extent in those days; certainly, everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
went to show that he foresaw, or expected, his own
approaching death.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p>This was all some years ago.</p>

<p>Maud Kingsford and Templemore were married shortly
after; and Stella and Harry Lorien are now married too.
And, when the two sisters appear in society, they excite
admiration, not only by their beauty, but also by their
matchless jewels&mdash;that once glittered on the bosom of
Ulama, Princess of Manoa, and that had adorned, probably,
the persons of generations of descendants of former
mighty kings of that once mighty empire.</p>

<p>But of this nothing is known to the general public.
Templemore and his friends have kept the promise he
gave, and preserved the secret of Roraima. It was
only a short time ago that circumstances arose that
seemed to him to justify a departure from the course
he had hitherto observed. This was when the dispute
which has been dormant for just upon a hundred years
respecting the boundaries of British Guiana suddenly
reached an acute stage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; he said to his wife, then, &ldquo;I think this
is the contingency our friend Monella must have had
in his mind when he intimated that in certain circumstances
I was to be free to depart from the silence
he had enjoined. It seems to me more than ever
the case that he must have had &lsquo;the gift of prophecy&rsquo;
at that time. I cannot doubt that, if he were alive now,
and saw that the future international position of Roraima
was hanging in the balance, he would wish it to become
permanently British territory, rather than Venezuelan.
And, if he could know of the present state of indifference&mdash;or
want of information&mdash;that seems to prevail in England,
I feel satisfied he would wish me to do what I could to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
awaken the English nation to the true facts of the question
that is at stake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that is how it has come about that, after
some years of silence, this strange story of Roraima
and the ancient city of El Dorado is now given to the
world.</p>
